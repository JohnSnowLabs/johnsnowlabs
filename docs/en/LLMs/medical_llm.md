There is overwhelming evidence from both academic research and industry benchmarks that domain-specific, task-optimized large language models consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs in healthcare. At John Snow Labs, weâ€™ve developed a suite of Medical LLMs purpose-built for clinical, biomedical, and life sciences applications.

Our models are designed to deliver best-in-class performance across a wide range of medical tasksâ€”from clinical reasoning and diagnostics to medical research comprehension and genetic analysis.

*Note: All memory calculations are based on half-precision (fp16/bf16) weights. Recommended GPU Memory considers the model size and the maximum key-value cache at the model's maximum sequence length. These calculations follow the guidelines from [DJL's LMI Deployment Guide.](https://docs.djl.ai/master/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/deployment_guide/instance-type-selection.html)*

## Introduction
John Snow Labsâ€™ latest 2025 release of its Medical Large Language Models advance Healthcare AI by setting new state-of-the-art accuracy on medical LLM benchmarks. This advances whatâ€™s achievable in a variety of real-world use cases including clinical assessment, medical question answering, biomedical research synthesis, and diagnostic decision support.

Leading the pack is their largest 70B model, which can read and understand up to 32,000 words at once â€“ thatâ€™s roughly 64 pages of medical text. The model is specially trained to work with medical information, from patient records to research papers, making it highly accurate for healthcare tasks. What makes this release special is how well the model performs while still being practical enough for everyday use in hospitals and clinics â€“ thanks to a suite of models in different sizes, that balance accuracy with speed, cost, and privacy.

## OpenMed Benchmark Performance
The comprehensive evaluation of John Snow Labsâ€™ Medical LLM suite encompasses multiple standardized benchmarks, providing a thorough assessment of their capabilities across various medical domains. These evaluations demonstrate not only the modelsâ€™ proficiency in medical knowledge but also their practical applicability in real-world healthcare scenarios.

The OpenMed evaluation framework represents one of the most rigorous testing environments for medical AI models, covering a broad spectrum of medical knowledge and clinical reasoning capabilities. Our models have undergone extensive testing across multiple categories, achieving remarkable results that validate their exceptional performance:
