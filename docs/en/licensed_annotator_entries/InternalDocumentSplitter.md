`InternalDocumentSplitter` splits large documents into small documents. `InternalDocumentSplitter` has setSplitMode method to decide how to split documents.

If splitMode is `recursive`, It takes the separators in order and splits subtexts if they are over the chunk length, considering optional overlap of the chunks.

Additionally, you can set
- custom patterns with setSplitPatterns
- whether patterns should be interpreted as regex with setPatternsAreRegex
- whether to keep the separators with setKeepSeparators
- whether to trim whitespaces with setTrimWhitespace
- whether to explode the splits to individual rows with setExplodeSplits

Parametres:

- `chunkSize`: Size of each chunk of text. This param is applicable only for "recursive" splitMode.
- `chunkOverlap`: Length of the overlap between text chunks, by default `0`. This param is applicable only for `recursive` splitMode.
- `splitPatterns`: Patterns to split the document.
patternsAreRegex. Whether to interpret the split patterns as regular expressions, by default `True`.
- `keepSeparators`: Whether to keep the separators in the final result , by default `True`. This param is applicable only for "recursive" splitMode.
- `explodeSplits`: Whether to explode split chunks to separate rows , by default `False`.
- `trimWhitespace`: Whether to trim whitespaces of extracted chunks , by default `True`.
- `splitMode`: The split mode to determine how text should be segmented. Default: 'regex'. It should be one of the following values:
  - "char": Split text based on individual characters.
  - "token": Split text based on tokens. You should supply tokens from inputCols.
  - "sentence": Split text based on sentences. You should supply sentences from inputCols.
  - "recursive": Split text recursively using a specific algorithm.
  - "regex": Split text based on a regular expression pattern.
- `sentenceAwareness`: Whether to split the document by sentence awareness if possible.
  - If true, it can stop the split process before maxLength.
  - If true, you should supply sentences from inputCols. Default: False.
  - This param is not applicable only for `regex` and `recursive` splitMode.
- `maxLength`: The maximum length allowed for spitting. The mode in which the maximum length is specified:
  - "char": Maximum length is measured in characters. Default: `512`
  - "token": Maximum length is measured in tokens. Default: `128`
  - "sentence": Maximum length is measured in sentences. Default: `8`
- `customBoundsStrategy`: The custom bounds strategy for text splitting using regular expressions. This param is applicable only for `regex` splitMode.
- `caseSensitive`: Whether to use case sensitive when matching regex, by default `False`. This param is applicable only for `regex` splitMode.
-  `metaDataFields`: Metadata fields to add specified data in columns to the metadata of the split documents.         You should set column names to read columns.
