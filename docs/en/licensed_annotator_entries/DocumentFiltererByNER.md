DocumentFiltererByNER

{%- capture model_description -%}
The `DocumentFiltererByNER` annotator returns sentences containing the entity chunks you have filtered, allowing you to see only the sentences with the entities you want.It is particularly useful for extracting and organizing the results obtained from Spark NLP Pipelines.

Parameters:

- `blackList`: If defined, list of entities to ignore. The rest will be processed.
- `whiteList`: If defined, list of entities to process. The rest will be ignored.
- `caseSensitive`: Determines whether the definitions of the white listed and black listed entities are case sensitive or not.
- `outputAsDocument`: Whether to return all sentences joined into a single document.(default : `False`).
- `joinString`: This parameter specifies the string that will be inserted between results of documents when combining them into a single result if outputAsDocument is set to `True` (default is : " ").
