You can see all features showcased in the demo notebook [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/nlu/blob/master/examples/colab/spark_nlp_utilities/NLU_utils_for_Spark_NLP.ipynb)

## nlp.viz(pipe,data)
Visualize input data with an already configured Spark NLP pipeline,  
for Algorithms of type (Ner,Assertion, Relation, Resolution, Dependency)  
using [Spark NLP Display](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/display)  
Automatically infers applicable viz type and output columns to use for visualization.  
Example:
```python
# works with Pipeline, LightPipeline, PipelineModel,PretrainedPipeline List[Annotator]
ade_pipeline = PretrainedPipeline('explain_clinical_doc_ade', 'en', 'clinical/models')

text = """I have an allergic reaction to vancomycin.
My skin has be itchy, sore throat/burning/itchy, and numbness in tongue and gums.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication."""

nlp.viz(ade_pipeline, text)

```
returns:

![nlp.viz(pipe,data)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSnowLabs/nlu/master/docs/assets/images/releases/4_0_0/nlu_utils_viz_example.png "lit_shadow")

If a pipeline has multiple models candidates that can be used for a viz,  
the first Annotator that is vizzable will be used to create viz.  
You can specify which type of viz to create with the viz_type parameter

Output columns to use for the viz are automatically deducted from the pipeline, by using the
first annotator that provides the correct output type for a specific viz.  
You can specify which columns to use for a viz by using the  
corresponding ner_col, pos_col, dep_untyped_col, dep_typed_col, resolution_col, relation_col, assertion_col, parameters.

## nlp.autocomplete_pipeline(pipe)
Auto-Complete a pipeline or single annotator into a runnable pipeline by harnessing NLU's DAG Autocompletion algorithm and returns it as NLU pipeline.
The standard Spark pipeline is avaiable on the `.vanilla_transformer_pipe` attribute of the returned nlp pipe

Every Annotator and Pipeline of Annotators defines a `DAG` of tasks, with various dependencies that must be satisfied in `topoligical order`.
NLU enables the completion of an incomplete DAG by finding or creating a path between
the very first input node which is almost always is `DocumentAssembler/MultiDocumentAssembler`
and the very last node(s), which is given by the `topoligical sorting` the iterable annotators parameter.
Paths are created by resolving input features of annotators to the corrrosponding providers with matching storage references.

Example:
```python
# Lets autocomplete the pipeline for a RelationExtractionModel, which as many input columns and sub-dependencies.
from sparknlp_jsl.annotator import RelationExtractionModel
re_model = RelationExtractionModel().pretrained("re_ade_clinical", "en", 'clinical/models').setOutputCol('relation')

text = """I have an allergic reaction to vancomycin.
My skin has be itchy, sore throat/burning/itchy, and numbness in tongue and gums.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication."""

nlu_pipe = nlp.autocomplete_pipeline(re_model)
nlu_pipe.predict(text)
```

Annotators are grouped internally by NLP into output levels `token`,`sentence`, `document`,`chunk` and `relation`
Same level annotators output columns are zipped and exploded together to create  the final output df.
Additionally, most keys from the metadata dictionary in the result annotations will be collected and expanded into their own columns in the resulting Dataframe, with special handling for Annotators that encode multiple metadata fields inside of one, seperated by strings like `|||`   or `:::`.
Some columns are omitted from metadata to reduce total amount of output columns, these can be re-enabled by setting `metadata=True`

For a given pipeline output level is automatically set to the last annotators output level by default.
This can be changed by defining `to_preddty_df(pipe,text,output_level='my_level'` for levels `token`,`sentence`, `document`,`chunk` and `relation` .
