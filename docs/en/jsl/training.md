You can fit load a trainable nlp pipeline via ```nlp.load('train.<model>')``` 

## Binary Text Classifier Training
[Sentiment classification training demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f-EORjO3IpvwRAktuL4EvZPqPr2IZ_g8?usp=sharing)        
To train a Sentiment classifier model, you must pass a dataframe with a ```text``` column and a ```y``` column for the label.
Uses a Deep Neural Network built in Tensorflow.       
By default *Universal Sentence Encoder Embeddings (USE)* are used as sentence embeddings.

```python
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('train.sentiment').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

To train on custom embeddings you can specify some sentence embeddings before the training reference which will be used instead of the default USE embeddings. 

```python
#Train Classifier on BERT sentence embeddings
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('embed_sentence.bert train.classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

```python
#Train Classifier on ELECTRA sentence embeddings
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('embed_sentence.electra train.classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

## Multi Class Text Classifier Training
[Multi Class Text Classifier Training Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12FA2TVvvRWw4pRhxDnK32WAzl9dbF6Qw?usp=sharing)

By default *Universal Sentence Encoder Embeddings (USE)* are used as sentence embeddings. 

```python

## Multi Label Classifier training
[ Train Multi Label Classifier on E2E dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ZqfNUqliRKP4UgaFcRg5KOSTkqrtDXy?usp=sharing)       
[Train Multi Label  Classifier on Stack Overflow Question Tags dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nmrncn-y559od3AKJglwfJ0VmZKjtMAF/view?usp=sharing)       
This model can predict multiple labels for one sentence.     
Uses a Bidirectional GRU with Convolution model that we have built inside TensorFlow and supports up to 100 classes.        
To train the Multi Class text classifier model, you must pass a dataframe with a ```text``` column and a ```y``` column for the label.   
The ```y``` label must be a string column where each label is seperated with a seperator.     
By default, ```,``` is assumed as line seperator.      
If your dataset is using a different label seperator, you must configure the ```label_seperator``` parameter while calling the ```fit()``` method.    

By default, *Universal Sentence Encoder Embeddings (USE)* are used as sentence embeddings for training.

```python
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

To train on custom embeddings you can specify some sentence embeddings before the training reference which will be used instead of the default USE embeddings.

```python
#Train on BERT sentence embeddings
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('embed_sentence.bert train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df)
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

Configure a custom line seperator
```python
#Use ; as label seperator
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('embed_sentence.electra train.multi_classifier').fit(train_df, label_seperator=';')
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

## Part of Speech (POS) Training

Your dataset must be in the form of [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/).
You must configure the dataset_path in the ```fit()``` method to point to the universal dependencies you wish to train on.       
You can configure the delimiter via the ```label_seperator``` parameter      
[POS training demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CZqHQmrxkDf7y3rQHVjO-97tCnpUXu_3?usp=sharing)

```python
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('train.pos').fit(dataset_path=train_path, label_seperator='_')
preds = fitted_pipe.predict(train_df)
```

## Named Entity Recognizer (NER) Training

[NER training demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_GwhdXULq45GZkw3157fAOx4Wqo-fmFV?usp=sharing)        
You can train your own custom NER model with an [CoNLL 20003 IOB](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf) formatted dataset.      
By default, *Glove 100d Token Embeddings* are used as features for the classifier.

```python
train_path = '/content/eng.train'
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('train.ner').fit(dataset_path=train_path)
```

If a nlp reference to a Token Embeddings model is added before the train reference, that Token Embedding will be used when training the NER model.

```python
# Train on BERT embeddigns
train_path = '/content/eng.train'
fitted_pipe = nlp.load('bert train.ner').fit(dataset_path=train_path)
```

## Chunk Entity Resolver Training
[Chunk Entity Resolver Training Tutorial Notebook]()
Named Entities are sub pieces in textual data which are labled with classes.    
These classes and strings are still ambious though and it is not possible to group semantically identically entities withouth any definition of `terminology`.
With the `Chunk Resolver` you can train a state of the art deep learning architecture to map entities to their unique terminological representation.

Train a chunk resolver on a dataset with columns named `y` , `_y` and `text`. `y` is a label, `_y` is an extra identifier label, `text` is the raw text

```python
import pandas as pd 
dataset = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': ['The Tesla company is good to invest is', 'TSLA is good to invest','TESLA INC. we should buy','PUT ALL MONEY IN TSLA inc!!'],
    'y': ['23','23','23','23']
    '_y': ['TESLA','TESLA','TESLA','TESLA'], 

})


trainable_pipe = nlp.load('train.resolve_chunks')
fitted_pipe  = trainable_pipe.fit(dataset)
res = fitted_pipe.predict(dataset)
fitted_pipe.predict(["Peter told me to buy Tesla ", 'I have money to loose, is TSLA a good option?'])
```

| '1.0000'                     | '23]                   | 'TESLA'           | I have money to loose, is TSLA a good option? |

## Rule based NER with Context Matcher
[Rule based NER with context matching tutorial notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/nlu/blob/master/examples/colab/Training/rule_based_named_entity_recognition_and_resolution/rule_based_NER_and_resolution_with_context_matching.ipynb)    
Define a rule based NER algorithm by providing Regex Patterns and resolution mappings.
The confidence value is computed  using a heuristic approach based on how many matches it has.    
A dictionary can be provided with setDictionary to map extracted entities to a unified representation. The first column of the dictionary file should be the representation with following columns the possible matches.

Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG . She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation . Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity . Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L . Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission . However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L . β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again . The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . Twenty days ago. Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use . At birth the typical boy is growing slightly faster than the typical girl, but the velocities become equal at about seven months, and then the girl grows faster until four years. From then until adolescence no differences in velocity can be detected. 21-02-2020 21/04/2020 """
