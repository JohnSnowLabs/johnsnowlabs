**Installing** 

## Annotator & PretrainedPipeline based pipelines
You can create [Legal Annotator & PretrainedPipeline based pipelines](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/jsl/concepts) using all the classes 
attached to the `legal` & `nlp` module after [installing the licensed libraries](/docs/en/jsl/install_licensed_quick).


`nlp.PretrainedPipeline('pipe_name')` gives access to [Pretrained Pipelines](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?type=pipeline)

```python
from johnsnowlabs import nlp
nlp.start()
deid_pipeline = nlp.PretrainedPipeline("legpipe_deid", "en", "legal/models")

sample_2 = """Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. Franchise Agreement This Franchise Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of the Agreement Date shown on the cover page between Pizza Fusion Holding, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the individual or legal entity identified on the cover page.

### Custom Pipes
Alternatively you can compose [Legal Annotators](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/licensed_annotators) & [Open Source Annotators](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators) into a pipeline which offers the highest degree of customization.

```python
from johnsnowlabs import nlp,legal
spark = nlp.start() 

documentAssembler = nlp.DocumentAssembler()\
    .setInputCol("text")\
    .setOutputCol("document")

sparktokenizer = nlp.Tokenizer()\
    .setInputCols("document")\
    .setOutputCol("token")

zero_shot_ner = legal.ZeroShotNerModel.pretrained("legner_roberta_zeroshot", "en", "legal/models")\
    .setInputCols(["document", "token"])\
    .setOutputCol("zero_shot_ner")\
    .setEntityDefinitions(
    {
        "DATE": ['When was the company acquisition?', 'When was the company purchase agreement?', "When was the agreement?"],
        "ORG": ["Which company?"],
        "STATE": ["Which state?"],
        "AGREEMENT": ["What kind of agreement?"],
        "LICENSE": ["What kind of license?"],
        "LICENSE_RECIPIENT": ["To whom the license is granted?"]
    })

nerconverter = nlp.NerConverter()\
    .setInputCols(["document", "token", "zero_shot_ner"])\
    .setOutputCol("ner_chunk")

pipeline =  nlp.Pipeline(stages=[
    documentAssembler,
    sparktokenizer,
    zero_shot_ner,
    nerconverter,
]
)

sample_text = ["In March 2012, as part of a longer-term strategy, the Company acquired Vertro, Inc., which owned and operated the ALOT product portfolio.",
               "In February 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with NetSeer, Inc.",
               "This INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT, dated as of December 31, 2018 (the 'Effective Date') is entered into by and between Armstrong Flooring, Inc., a Delaware corporation ('Seller') and AFI Licensing LLC, a Delaware company('Licensing')"
               "The Company hereby grants to Seller a perpetual, non- exclusive, royalty-free license"]

p_model = pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text"))

res = p_model.transform(spark.createDataFrame(sample_text, StringType()).toDF("text"))

res.select(nlp.F.explode(nlp.F.arrays_zip(res.ner_chunk.result, res.ner_chunk.begin, res.ner_chunk.end, res.ner_chunk.metadata)).alias("cols"))\
    .select(nlp.F.expr("cols['0']").alias("chunk"),
            nlp.F.expr("cols['3']['entity']").alias("ner_label"))\
    .filter("ner_label!='O'")\
    .show(truncate=False)\



```
Output:
