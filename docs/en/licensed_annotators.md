<div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

A Spark NLP Enterprise license includes access to unique annotators.
At the [Spark NLP Workshop](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/tree/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings) you can see different types of annotators in action.

By clicking on any annotator, you will see different sections:
- The `Approach`, or class to train models.
- The `Model`, to infer using pretrained models.

Also, for most of the annotators, you will find examples for the different enterprise libraries:
- Healthcare NLP
- Finance NLP
- Legal NLP

Check out the [Spark NLP Annotators page](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators) for more information on how to read this page.
