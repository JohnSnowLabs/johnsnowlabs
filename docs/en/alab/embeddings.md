All the embeddings available in the Generative AI Lab are listed on this page. General information about the embeddings like the name, version, source, and date of upload/download is available. Like models, any compatible embeddings can be downloaded from [NLP Models Hub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models). By default, `glove_100d`, `bert_base_cased`, `tfhub_use` embeddings are included in every fresh installation of Generative AI Lab.
