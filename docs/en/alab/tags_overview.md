NLP Lab enables the utilization of XML-like tags to configure the labeling interface. NLP Lab contains three distinct tag types for labeling management:

- `Object tags` serve for data types, presenting labeled elements within a task, which can be labeled as video, audio, HTML, images, PDF, and text.
- `Control tags` facilitate the annotation of objects. For instance, labels are employed in semantic and named entity tasks, and choices for classification tasks inside NLP Lab.
- `Visual tags` allow for changes to the visual elements of the labelling interface, giving control over the presentation of particular labeling choices or the presence of a header.

## Custom Labeling Configuration

A name parameter is required for each `Control` and `Object tag`. Every `Control tag` also needs a toName parameter that matches the name parameter of the object tag in the configuration. Suppose you wish to assign labels to text for a Named Entity Recognition task. In that case, you could use the following labeling configuration:

![NER-xml-tag](/assets/images/annotation_lab/xml-tags/NER_labels.png)

In this case, text is annotated using the `Label tags` in combination with the `Text tag`. Multiple control and `Object tags` may be used in the same configuration by creating linkages between them using names.

### Variables

All `Object tags`, as well as some `Control` and `Visual tags`, support variables within their arguments. Using variables enables for the creation of a labeling configuration, while also allowing for the control of given information on the labeling interface based on data in a given task.
To use a variable, define it with the value parameter of a tag and specify it using the $ sign and the name of the field that you want to reference. For example, if you have a sample task which contains some partial JSON, then the configuration should look something like this:

![Headers-tag](/assets/images/annotation_lab/xml-tags/header_variables.png)

When you look on the preview window, you can see the header set on top of the labels/choices.
