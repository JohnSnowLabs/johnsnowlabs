## 6.11.3

Release date: **03-12-2024**

### Improvements & Bug Fixes
- Fixed Double Labeling Issue: Resolved an issue where applying a different label to an already labeled chunk resulted in duplicate labels.
- Assertion Labeling in Image and Text Side By Side Projects: Fixed a bug preventing users from adding assertion labels by clicking on tokens in the Image and Text Side By Side project type.
- Improved Assertion Label Replacement: Users can now seamlessly replace existing assertion labels for annotations instead of duplicating them.
