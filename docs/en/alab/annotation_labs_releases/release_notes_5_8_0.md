## Centralized Log Access from Clusters Page
NLP Lab 5.8 introduces another new feature that simplifies server management by granting users direct access to server logs from the Clusters page. This feature provides critical insights, especially when troubleshooting issues across various server functions. This enhancement eliminates the need for manual command-line access, ensuring easy log retrieval and facilitating efficient troubleshooting. 

### Effortless Log Viewing from the Clusters Page
Navigating to the Clusters page, users can now easily access logs for all deployed servers, including training, preannotation, OCR, and playground servers. A dedicated button has been added to the cluster page, providing a single point of access for viewing server logs.

![1](/assets/images/annotation_lab/5.8.0/3.png)

This streamlined approach to viewing server logs enhances the user experience and operational efficiency within NLP Lab, offering a more intuitive and accessible way to manage and diagnose server-related issues.

### Improvements

#### New Gesture for Assertion Status Annotation 
Annotating assertions has historically been a tedious task, requiring users to repeatedly select an already annotated text fragment and assign an assertion label. To address this issue, we introduce a gesture-based annotation mechanism that simplifies the process significantly.

This new gesture enables users to annotate a text chunk with a single click, followed by the selection of the desired assertion label. This immediate action eliminates the need for repeated selections, significantly reducing annotation time and effort. The new gesture applies specifically to the assertion label on the clicked token or chunk, ensuring precise annotation without ambiguity.

To further enhance user experience, assertion labels in the label selection widget are now decorated with a dotted line, effectively distinguishing them from NER labels and preventing any potential confusion. This visual indication reinforces the distinction between assertion labels and NER labels, allowing users to make informed choices seamlessly.

#### Model Evaluation servers are now queued
A refinement has been implemented in version 5.8, whereby the Test Configuration for Model Evaluation is queued when there are insufficient resources. Users now can abort the test configuration (evaluation) if triggered unintentionally. Furthermore, a pop-up is presented to guide users in deleting an existing server when the maximum server count is reached.

NLP Lab 5.8 adds another improvement addressing resource constraints during model evaluation. The Test Configuration feature, which evaluates a model for the current project tasks, is now intelligently queued until sufficient resources are available. Additionally, a user-friendly feature allows users to abort the test configuration in case of accidental initiation. Furthermore, a helpful popup appears when the maximum server count is reached, guiding users through the process of deleting an existing server to free up resources for new evaluations.

![1](/assets/images/annotation_lab/5.8.0/6.jpeg)

#### Task Assignment from the Tasks Page
Another enhancement introduced by NLP Lab 5.8 refers to the process of assigning annotators and reviewers to specific tasks. Now, directly from the task details page, users can allocate annotators and reviewers to a tasks without the need to navigate to the tasks list, and thus lose the current work context. This improvement not only saves valuable time but also enhances the user experience by simplifying task management within the platform. 

By enabling direct assignment of annotators and reviewers from the task details, we ensure a more efficient workflow, allowing users to focus on project execution with fewer interruptions and less navigational overhead.

#### Alphabet Resource Support in Rules for Enhanced Language Processing
NLP Lab 5.8 offers language support for French, German, Greek, and Spanish characters within free rules. This enhancement empowers users to incorporate special characters such as Ã©, Ã­, Î±, Î², Î³, Î´, Ã¼, ÃŸ, and more into their dictionaries while creating rules and using them for pre-annotation, expanding the application's versatility in handling diverse language requirements.

By incorporating special characters into free rules, users can achieve more accurate and reliable pre-annotation results, enhancing their overall workflow efficiency and productivity.

#### Disable "Filter Tasks by Tags" when Tasks Splitting with Test/Train Tags is Selected
When segregating training data based on Test/Train tags, the system now omits the tag-based filter. As a result, tasks marked for testing are exclusively considered for the testing phase, whereas the remaining tasks are automatically designated for training.

![1](/assets/images/annotation_lab/5.8.0/9.png)

#### Updated Filter: "Filter Pre-annotation according to the sections of my latest completion"

For Section-Based Projects, where one task can have different section segmentations created by different annotators as part of their work, NLP Lab provides the ability to pre-annotate tasks for all the available sections. To enhance intuitiveness, a filter is provided to selectively display pre-annotation labels only for the sections of the latest completion of each task. The filter description has been updated to better convey its functionality to our users.

#### Enhanced Performance in Visual NER Pipeline
Version 5.8 introduces substantial efficiency improvement of task import within OCR-based projects. These improvements are primarily aimed at reducing memory consumption and enhancing the loading efficiency of pipelines, thereby elevating overall performance during task import.

Key updates include a more memory-efficient OCR pipeline that eliminates the need for multiple loadings throughout the task import process. This refinement leads to a more streamlined and effective use of memory, facilitating a smoother import experience.

Users leveraging OCR pipelines for task imports in NER projects should note:

- Server operations may still halt upon reaching memory capacity limits, which is to be anticipated.
- In scenarios where multiple pipelines are deployed for task imports, performance, and memory usage metrics are consistent with those observed in the previous release.
- 
#### Improved Experience on Upgrade
The upgrade pathway in NLP Lab has been refined in version 5.8, particularly addressing the challenges related to admin password changes through the UI. Previously, such changes led to upgrade failures, necessitating a manual update of the password in the 'annotationlab-updater' configuration. We are pleased to report that this issue has been effectively resolved in the latest release, ensuring a more fluid and user-friendly upgrade process.

![1](/assets/images/annotation_lab/5.8.0/10.png)

When initiating an upgrade to version 5.8 or beyond, users will be prompted to enter the new admin password, should it have been modified. This step is designed to automate the admin password update, thereby removing the need for manual adjustments to configuration files. Users who have not changed their admin password can simply proceed by pressing "Enter." This enhancement not only streamlines the upgrade process but also minimizes the likelihood of errors and saves valuable time.
### Bug Fixes

- **Filter in Models Hub page incorrectly lists Pipelines when Healthcare is selected in edition filter**
    
    In the past, when utilizing filters on the Models Hub page to display healthcare-type models, pipelines were inadvertently included in the list. The filter conditions have now been refined to accurately distinguish between models and pipelines. As a result, the Models Hub page no longer displays OCR pipelines when filtered specifically for healthcare-related content.

- **Downloaded embedding status not updating without refresh**

    In the past, after an Embedding was successfully downloaded, it continued to display the status "downloading," leaving the user waiting without notification. This issue has now been resolved.

- **SDOH classification models do not give any pre-annotation results**

    Previously, there was an issue where SDOH classification models did not provide results for any task. This issue has been resolved, and the model can now be deployed in the playground and utilized for pre-annotation in projects without encountering any errors.

- **Error When users without admin privilege import projects**

    Previously, non-admin users attempting to import a project with team members encountered an internal server error. This issue has been addressed, and now, if a non-admin user attempts to import a project with users not yet existing in the application, the import process fails with an appropriate error message.

- **During bulk pre-annotation if it fails for a single task, pre-annotation fails for all the tasks in the Visual NER project**

    Previously, users were unable to pre-annotate multiple tasks simultaneously, and if one pre-annotation failed, the entire batch of selected tasks would also fail. The current implementation has enhanced memory usage, allowing for improved bulk pre-annotation. Now, pre-annotation for all tasks does not fail as it did before. However, tasks are pre-annotated until the pre-annotation server memory limit is reached. Subsequently, pre-annotation fails for the remaining tasks, which need to be selected and pre-annotated again.

- **Clicking on the labels part of edition dropdown in NLP Models Hub Page does not select/unselect the checkbox**

    Previously, clicking on labels in the edition dropdown on the NLP Models Hub Page did not effectively select/unselect the checkbox. This issue has been resolved, filters are now successfully selected when the corresponding text is clicked.

- **Benchmarking details Popup for trained RE Models shows Epoch values**

    Initially, the Training Logs for the RE model did not display Benchmarking data. Clicking on the Benchmarking button presented Epoch Values instead of the expected Benchmarking Data in the Benchmarking PopUp. Now, the Benchmarking Data is appropriately shown at the end of the training logs for RE models. Additionally, this Benchmarking Data is also visible on the Benchmarking UI on the Models Page.

- **Reuse Resources: Unable to remove RE models from the models list shown during "Multi-embeddings detected" case**

    Previously, attempting to remove the RE model from the Multi-embeddings detected list displayed a confirmation message, but it was not effectively removed from the configuration. The tick mark associated with the RE model persisted. Now, the RE model is removed from the Multi Embeddings detected list in the same manner as other models, ensuring both the confirmation message and the tick mark are appropriately handled.

- **Training Page: Saved Training Settings are reset when the training type changes**

    On the Training Page, there was a problem where saved training settings would be reset when the training type was changed. Initially, the saved settings, including embeddings, license type, and Transfer Learning, were not persisting. However, this issue has now been resolved, and the saved settings remain unchanged when altering the training type.

- **Playground: The text field to insert text to test models/prompts/rules in playground is disabled but editable**

    In the Playground, the text field for inserting text to test models/prompts/rules was disabled yet still editable. Although the added text did not affect the results, the disabled text field allowed editing. Now, users cannot edit the text field when it is disabled.

- **Task name not imported while importing tasks for Rate PDF projects**

    Previously, when importing tasks for Rate PDF projects, the task name was not included. This issue has been resolved, the imported tasks can be opened without encountering any errors.

- **Error when importing sample task for SBA project**

    In the previous version, sample tasks were not imported for both text and visual-based SBA projects. Issue is now fixed.
