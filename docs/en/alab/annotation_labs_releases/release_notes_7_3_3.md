## Generative AI Lab 7.3.3 
<p style="text-align:center;">Release date: 08-15-2025</p>

## Improvements
- The "Tasks per page" selection on the Tasks page is now preserved even after a hard refresh, ensuring consistent viewing preferences across sessions.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue in older LLM Comparison projects where configuring LLM for responses incorrectly added "undefined" to the project configuration.
- Resolved slow login page load times in air-gapped environments caused by attempts to download external fonts.
- Fixed an issue that prevented training of Visual NER projects.
- Addressed a bug where importing multiple tasks via JSON format.
