| Project                 | A project in Generative AI Lab   resembles a set of tasks  that need to   be annotated and/or reviewed by users in order to extract structured data   and/or to train a DL model.Think of it as a factory assembly line for producing   labels. For jumpstarting annotations on a project preannotations generated by   existing models and/or rules can be used.  |
| Project   configuration | Specifies the type of documents   that will be annotated as well as the labels, classes and relations which   will be used for annotation. A project configuration can also reuse existing   labels, classes and relations from pre-trained models or rules.                                                                                                    |
| Model                   | In the context of the Annotation   Lab use, the term model refers to a DL model build using John Snow Labs NLP   libraries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Predictions             | Annotations automatically   generated by Spark NLP models or user defined Spark NLP rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Completions             | A series of annotations manually   created or copied from automatic predictions and edited/validated by human   annotators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Task                    | A document that needs to be   annotated by an annotator with or without the use of preannotation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
