## AWS Marketplace

The Generative AI Lab needs to be installed on a virtual machine. One of the most straight forward method is an installation from AWS Marketplace (also available on Azure). The fee for the Generative AI Lab depends on the number of CPU and GPU in the selected instance (Details can be listed in the product page in AWS marketplace). You will also have to pay for the underlying AWS EC2 instance.

Visit the [product page on AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zrcp6k6nqvxoa) and follow the instructions on the video below to subscribe and deploy.

**Steps to get started:**
- Subscribe to the product on the AWS Marketplace.
- Deploy it on a new machine.
- In Launch an instance configuration attach IAM role to the AMI (IAM role attached to the AMI machine should have access to both `aws-marketplace:MeterUsage` and `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` permission)

- In advance details, enable `Metadata accessible` and select `V1 and V2` in `Metadata version`

	![metadata](/assets/images/annotation_lab/metadata.png)

- Access the login page for a guided experience on `http://INSTANCE_IP`. For the first login use the following credentials:
	Username: admin
	Password: INSTANCE_ID

## Secure access to Generative AI Lab on AWS

When installed via the AWS Marketplace, Generative AI Lab has a private IP address and listens on an unsecured HTTP port. You can ask your DevOps department to incorporate the resource to your standard procedures to access from the internet in a secure manner. Alternatively, a Cloud Formation script is available that can be used to create a front end proxy (CloudFront, ELB, and auxiliary Lambda Function). Those resources are Free Tier Eligible. 

Create the AWS Cloud Formation Script in YAML format:
   
   ```console
   vi cloudformation_https.yaml
   ```

   ```console
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Metadata:
  License: Apache-2.0
Description: 'AWS CloudFormation To access Generative AI Lab via https:
  Create an Amazon EC2 instance running the Generative AI Lab Amazon Linux AMI. Once the
  Generative AI Lab instance is created, provide instance hostname as input. This Cloudfromation
  Creates Cloudfront. You can use Cloudfront Domain URL to access Generative AI Lab
  via https protocol.
  '
Parameters:
  NLPlabInstanceHostName:
    Description: HostName of the Generative AI Lab InstanceID

Outputs:
  CloudfrontURL:
    Description: Cloudfront URL to access Generative AI Lab
    Value: !Join ["", ['https://', !GetAtt [CloudFront, DomainName]]]

   ```

Click Create a stack, “Upload a template file”. Give the Stack a name and enter the Generative AI Lab instance Hostname(from the EC2 console) as a parameter.

![createStack](/assets/images/annotation_lab/aws/createStack.png)

Next -> Next -> Acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources. -> Submit. Wait a few minutes until all resources are created.  

![ack](/assets/images/annotation_lab/aws/ack.png)

Once created, go do the Outputs tab and click on the Generative AI Lab URL. You may need to refresh the view. 

![output](/assets/images/annotation_lab/aws/output.png)

Now, to access the Generative AI Lab, you go to the CloudFront URL and log in with username “admin” and password equal to the EC2 Instance ID noted earlier.

### Enabling SSL
#### Requirements:
- Fullchain certificate
- Private key used to sign the certificate

For ease of documenting the process we are going to use the following notations (please replace with your actual values in the process):

- fullchain.pem – name of the fullchain certificate file
- privkey.pem – key used to sign the certificate
- demo.example.com – the domain used for genailab app

For marketplace instance, the installer scripts files have to be downloaded (if installed with the the scripts, the files are already on the server and this step can be skipped):

```bash
wget -q https://s3.amazonaws.com/auxdata.johnsnowlabs.com/annotationlab/annotationlab-"$version".tar.gz
```

Extract the archive and copy fullchain.pem and privkey.pem into artifacts directory.

Create Kubernetes secret to be used by the ingress for SSL termination:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls demo.example.com --cert=fullchain.pem --key=privkey.pem
```

Edit the annotationlab-updater.sh in the same directory and add the following lines in the end of the script (helm command extra parameters):

```bash
--set ingress.enabled=true \
--set ingress.defaultBackend=false \
--set ingress.hosts[0].host='demo.example.com' \
--set ingress.hosts[0].path='/' \
--set ingress.tls[0].hosts[0]='demo.example.com' \
--set ingress.tls[0].secretName=demo.example.com
```

Note: If a self-signed certificate or any other type of internal certificates (not signed by any public CA) are used, an extra parameter is required for annotationlab-updater.sh:

```bash
--set ingress.sslVerify=false
```

After editing the script, run it to enable SSL:

```bash
bash -x annotationlab-updater.sh
```

## Azure Marketplace

Visit the [product page on Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/johnsnowlabsinc1646051154808.gen_ai_lab?tab=Overview) and follow these steps.
