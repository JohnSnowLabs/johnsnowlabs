## 5.0.2

Release date: 16-10-2023

**We are glad to announce that Visual NLP 5.0.2 has been released! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€   New features, new models, bug fixes, and more!  ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢** 


This is a small compatibility release to ensure the product runs smoothly on Google Colab, and that it remains compatible with the latest versions of Spark NLP and Spark NLP for Healthcare.

**Changes :** ðŸ“£

+ Google Colab installation issues have been solved. 

+ New setting for M1 compatibility in Spark-NLP dependency: 
  ```bash
  start(m1=True|False)
  use m1=True 
  ``` 
  use m1=True enables the M1 compatible version of Spark-NLP.

+  ```  New ImageToTextV3 annotator ```  : this is a new version of the original LSTM based ImageToText annotator, with the difference that it accepts input regions in a similar fashion to ImageToTextV2. In the original ImageToText implementation all layout analysis happens implicitly within the annotator itself, without external help.

This release is compatible with ```Spark NLP 5.1.1``` and Spark NLP for``` Healthcare 5.1.1```
