## New Base64ToBinary Annotator
This new annotator, as its name suggests, serves the purpose of converting in-memory base64 encoded buffers into binary format. This is useful, among other things, for the use case in which your data is not stored in disk, and it can be really helpful in combination with PdfToText, or PdfToImage, e.g.,

```
base64_to_bin = Base64ToBinary()
base64_to_bin.setOutputCol("content")

pdf_to_image = PdfToImage()
pdf_to_image.setInputCol("content")
pdf_to_image.setOutputCol("image")
pdf_to_image.setImageType(ImageType.TYPE_3BYTE_BGR)


# Run OCR for each region
ocr = ImageToText()
ocr.setInputCol("image")
ocr.setOutputCol("text")

# OCR pipeline
pipeline = PipelineModel(stages=[
    base64_to_bin,
    pdf_to_image,
    ocr
])
```


For an end-to-end example which also includes LightPipelines please check [this notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-ocr-workshop/blob/master/jupyter/SparkOcrLightPipelinesBase64.ipynb).
