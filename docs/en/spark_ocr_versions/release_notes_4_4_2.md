* PdfToText and PdfToHocr now return document dimensions using the same data type(integer).
* Remaining 2 vulnerabilities from release 4.4.1 in JAR package are now gone.

New Features
+ Bounding boxes spawning multiple lines are now supported in PositionFinder!

Here for "Lockheed Martin" PositionFinder will return two bounding boxes. Remember that you can still link the two bounding boxes to the original entity by using the 'chunk index'.

* Support for Spark 3.4.
* [Guidelines for building Visual NLP into a Java app.](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-ocr-workshop/blob/master/java/build_env_setup.md)
