#### Introducing a New State-of-The-Art Text2SQL Model Supporting Custom Database Schemas with Single Tables

We are excited to introduce the new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Large Language Model (LLM) designed to convert natural language questions into SQL queries, with support for custom database schemas containing single tables. This model has demonstrated superior performance compared to the current SOTA model (Defog's SQLCoder) by a margin of 6 points (**0.86 to 0.92**) when evaluated on a novel dataset that was not included in training (specifically tailored for the clinical domain). The model is obtained by finetuning an LLM on an augmented dataset containing schemas with single tables.

*Example*:

```python
query_schema = {
    "medical_treatment":         
        ["patient_id","patient_name","age","gender","diagnosis","treatment","doctor_name","hospital_name","admission_date","discharge_date"]
}

text2sql = Text2SQL.pretrained("text2sql_with_schema_single_table_augmented", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setMaxNewTokens(200)\
    .setSchema(query_schema)\
    .setInputCols(["document"])\
    .setOutputCol("sql")

question = "What is the average age of male patients with 'Diabetes'?"
```

*Result*:

```bash
[SELECT AVG(age) FROM medical_treatment WHERE gender = 'male' AND diagnosis = 'diabetes']
```

#### 4 New Arabic De-Identification NER Models 

We're thrilled to present our newly integrated Arabic deidentification Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, featuring two diverse approaches. The first model provides granular entity recognition with 17 entities, while the other offers a more generic approach, identifying 8 entities with AraBERT Arabic Embeddings. These models are accompanied by corresponding pretrained pipelines that can be deployed in a streamlined one-liner format.

Designed explicitly for deidentification tasks in the Arabic language, these models leverage our proprietary dataset curation and specialized augmentation methods. This expansion broadens the linguistic scope of our toolset, underscoring our commitment to providing comprehensive solutions for global healthcare NLP needs.

#### 2 New Classification Models for Healthcare Social Determinants of Healthcare Concepts within Financial and Food Insecurity Contexts

Introducing two cutting-edge classification models tailored to address critical social determinants of healthcare: financial and food insecurity. These models, [genericclassifier_sdoh_financial_insecurity_mpnet](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/09/19/genericclassifier_sdoh_financial_insecurity_mpnet_en.html) and [genericclassifier_sdoh_food_insecurity_mpnet](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/09/19/genericclassifier_sdoh_food_insecurity_mpnet_en.html) have been meticulously designed to categorize healthcare-related text into key classifications.

*Example*:

```python
embeddings = MPNetEmbeddings.pretrained("mpnet_embedding_nli_mpnet_base_v2", "en")\
    .setInputCols(["document"])\
    .setOutputCol("sentence_embeddings")\

features_asm = FeaturesAssembler()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"])\
    .setOutputCol("features")

gen_clf = GenericClassifierModel.pretrained("genericclassifier_sdoh_financial_insecurity_mpnet", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols("features")\
    .setOutputCol("prediction")\

text_list = [
"Patient B is a 40-year-old female who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has received a treatment plan that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.",
"The patient a 35-year-old woman, visited her healthcare provider with concerns about her health. She bravely shared that she was facing financial difficultie, which was affecting her ability to afford necessary medical care and prescriptions. The caring healthcare provider listened attentively and discussed various options. They helped Sarah explore low-cost alternatives for her medications and connected her with local resources that could assist with healthcare expenses. By addressing the financial aspect, Sarah's healthcare provider ensured that she could receive the care she needed without further straining her finances. Leaving the appointment, Sarah felt relieved and grateful for the support in managing her health amidst her financial challenges."

#### Introducing a New BioBERT-Based Drug Adverse Event Classifier

This [bert_sequence_classifier_vop_adverse_event](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/09/20/bert_sequence_classifier_vop_adverse_event_en.html) model is specialized for analyzing adverse events related to drugs in health documents. Trained on in-house annotated health text, it classifies text into two categories:

`True`: Signifying the presence of unfavorable, unintended, or harmful signs or symptoms in patients receiving pharmaceutical products or medical devices.

`False`: Denoting the absence of unfavorable experiences during the course of treatment.

*Example*:

```python
sequenceClassifier = MedicalBertForSequenceClassification.pretrained("bert_sequence_classifier_vop_adverse_event", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["document", "token"])\
    .setOutputCol("prediction")

text_list = [
"I am taking this medication once a day for the last 3 days. I am feeling very bad, pressure on my head, some chest pain, cramps on my neck and feel very weird. I want to reduce my blood pressure naturally. Can I stop this medication? I only took it for 5 days. I was reading here, that a lot of people has been losing weight and exercise and now they have a normal blood pressure. Please let me know, what I can do. The sides effects are horrible",
"I go the pub about 3-4 times a week and drink quite a bit. I like socialising, been doing so for years now.Recently been getting this occasional pain from the liver area (under right ribs).It comes and goes. Could this be a sign of liver damage?When i get this pain i am usually in the pub drinking.If i press the area under my right rib cage about half way across i can feel pain. Is that pain in the Liver?"
