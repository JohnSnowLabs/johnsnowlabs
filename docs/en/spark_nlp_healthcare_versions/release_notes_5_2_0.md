#### A tutorial to Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Based Clinical Catbot Using LLMs with John Snow Labs in Databricks

In an era witnessing rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatbot technologies, this informative session emphasizes the benefits of employing LLM systems based on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Particularly valuable in scenarios where precision in responses holds significance—such as addressing queries concerning medical patients or clinical protocols—RAG LLMs excel by providing accurate answers while minimizing imaginative outputs. They achieve this by explaining the source of each fact, mitigating errors, and utilizing private documents for information retrieval. Additionally, these systems facilitate near-real-time data updates without necessitating LLM reconfiguration.

This tutorial guides participants through the creation of a RAG Large Language Model (LLM) clinical chatbot system. Leveraging John Snow Labs’ specialized healthcare-oriented LLM and NLP models integrated into the Databricks platform, the system employs LLMs to query a knowledge base via a vector database populated by Healthcare NLP at scale within a Databricks notebook. Utilizing a user-friendly graphical interface, users can engage in productive conversations with the system, thereby enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of healthcare workflows.

Of paramount importance, the system is developed with a focus on data privacy, security, and compliance. It operates entirely within customers’ cloud infrastructure, ensuring zero data sharing and eliminating external API calls, thereby safeguarding sensitive healthcare information.

#### Clinical Document Section Classifier Models to Classify the Sections within Clinical Documents

The latest development introduces two new Section Header Classifier models aimed at leveraging Bert models for the classification of text within clinical documents, focusing on specific sections within the document structure. These models facilitate the categorization of text into distinct sections according to a defined taxonomy, including sections such as **Complications and Risk Factors, Consultation and Referral, Diagnostic and Laboratory Data, Discharge Information, Habits, History, Patient Information, Procedures, Impression, and Others**.

The classifier model has a `headless` version too to cover the use cases in which there is no specific section header included in the section text. This allows classifying the sections even without a major clue (e.g. header, title, etc.) to indicate the section by itself.

These models offer enhanced capabilities to precisely classify clinical document text content into specific sections, aiding in structured information extraction and facilitating streamlined analysis within healthcare and clinical research domains.

#### Introducing `DocumentFiltererByClassifier` to Filter the Documents or Document Sections Using Classifier Outcomes

The `DocumentFiltererByClassifier` function is designed to filter documents based on the outcomes generated by classifier annotators. It operates using a white list and a black list. The white list comprises classifier results that meet the criteria to pass through the filter, while the black list includes results that are prohibited from passing through. This filtering process is sensitive to cases by default. However, by setting `caseSensitive` to `False`, the filter becomes case-insensitive, allowing for a broader range of matches based on the specified criteria. This function serves as an effective tool for systematically sorting and managing documents based on specific classifier outcomes, facilitating streamlined document handling and organization. Here is an example on how to use this module with `DocumentSplitter` to filter out a specific section/ split based on a classifier.


*Example*:

```python
document_splitter = InternalDocumentSplitter() \
    .setInputCols("document")\
    .setOutputCol("splits")\
    .setSplitMode("recursive")\
    .setChunkSize(100)\
    .setChunkOverlap(3)\
    .setExplodeSplits(True)\
    .setSplitPatterns(["\n\n", "\n"])\

sequenceClassifier = MedicalBertForSequenceClassification\
    .pretrained('bert_sequence_classifier_clinical_sections', 'en', 'clinical/models')\
    .setInputCols(["splits", "token"])\
    .setOutputCol("prediction")\
    .setCaseSensitive(False)

document_filterer = DocumentFiltererByClassifier()\
    .setInputCols(["splits", "prediction"])\
    .setOutputCol("filteredDocuments")\
    .setWhiteList(["Diagnostic and Laboratory Data"])\
    .setCaseSensitive(False)
```

#### Robust Exception Handling To Allow Skipping The Corrupted Records Processed Via `NERConverter`, `ChunkMapperModel`, `DocMapperModel`, `SentenceEntityResolverModel`, `RelationExtractonModel`, `RelationExtractonDLModel` and `AssertionDLModel` Annotators

We added `doExceptionHandling` parameter into `NERConverterInternal`, `ChunkMapperModel`, `DocMapperModel`, `SentenceEntityResolverModel`, `RelationExtractonModel`, `RelationExtractonDLModel` and  `AssertionDLModel` annotators for a robust exception handling if the process is broken down due to corrupted inputs. If it is set as `True`, the annotator tries to process as usual and ff exception-causing data (e.g. corrupted record/ document) is passed to the annotator, an exception warning is emitted which has the exception message. **Processing continues with the next one** while the rest of the drecords within the same batch is parsed without interruption. The default behavious is `False` and will throw exception and break the process to inform users.

*Example*:

```python
clinical_ner = MedicalNerModel.pretrained("ner_oncology", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("ner")\
    .setDoExceptionHandling(True)

#### Introducing The `enableSentenceIncrement` Parameter In `InternalDocumentSplitter`, Offering Precise Sentence Indexing Control For Streamlined Text Processing With Annotators Like `SentenceDetector`

The `enableSentenceIncrement` parameter holds significance as it directly influences the management of sentence indexing within the document splitting process. By regulating this feature, users gain more precise control over sentence index increments in metadata. This functionality is particularly valuable when employing split documents in subsequent annotators, such as the `SentenceDetector`, ensuring accurate and streamlined processing of text data.

*Example*:

```python
document_splitter = InternalDocumentSplitter() \
    .setInputCols(["document", "sentence"]) \
    .setOutputCol("splits") \
    .setSplitMode("sentence") \
    .setMaxLength(2)\
    .setExplodeSplits(True)\
    .setEnableSentenceIncrement(True)
