####  Support for John Snow Labs' LLMs/VLMs on Databricks 

John Snow Labs’ LLMs/VLMs now support seamless integration with Databricks, enabling efficient deployment and use of lightweight large language models (LLMs) in gguf format. These modules are designed to facilitate interaction with LLMs that have been converted into the gguf format—optimized for performance and resource efficiency. They make it possible to use John Snow Labs’ licensed, domain-specific models directly within the Databricks environment.

Features:
- Model Flexibility: Supports various model sizes tailored to medical and healthcare-related tasks.
- Comprehensive API: Provides methods for setting parameters, loading models, generating text outputs, and retrieving metadata.
- Simplifies the deployment of specialized LLMs on Databricks.
- Enables efficient inference with smaller model footprints.
- Ensures compliance with John Snow Labs’ licensing for secure enterprise use.

please see the example [AutoGGUFModel](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/databricks/python/healthcare-nlp/30.0.MedicalLLM.ipynb) and  [Multi_Modal_LLMs](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/databricks/python/healthcare-nlp/30.1.Multi_Modal_LLMs.ipynb) notebooks

####  John Snow Labs Containerized LLM/VLM Solutions for Databricks Container Services and Other Platforms

We provide containerized Large Language Model (LLM) solutions that can be seamlessly deployed in Databricks or any other environment supporting Docker. These solutions enable users to run JSL’s healthcare-specific LLMs locally within containerized clusters—without relying on external APIs.

By configuring a Databricks cluster with the provided Docker image and license environment variables, users can immediately access and run models such as text-only, vision, and reasoning variants. Each model is pre-packaged and ready for inference directly within the container, ensuring performance, security, and data privacy.

This setup allows healthcare and enterprise users to easily load, execute, and scale LLM workloads in isolated and compliant environments, making it ideal for production-grade deployments across various infrastructure setups.

- 1. Configure the cluster

    In databricks, go to cluster configuration and add the image name and tag. Also need to add the environment variables with the following:
    
    - Go to Compute -> Configuration -> Advenced -> Spark -> Environment variables, and set your license variable
    ```
    SPARK_NLP_LICENSE=eyXXXX......
    ```
    
    - Go to Compute -> Configuration -> Advenced -> Docker
    ```
    Docker Image URL: docker.io/johnsnowlabs/dockerized-applications-healthcare:dbr-llm-test-201
    Authentication: Username and password
    UserName: <docker hub user name>
    Password: <docker hub user password>
    ```

    - Run the notebook using this cluster. Add the following in the first cell of the notebook
    
    ```python
    # this section only needs for onDataBricks 
    import sys
    import runpy
    sys.path.extend(["/", "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages"])
    runpy.run_path("/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sitecustomize.py")
    ```

#### New Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Classification Model

John Snow Labs introduces a new Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Classification Model designed to accurately distinguish between clinical documents that reference IBD and those that do not. 
The model classifies input text into two categories:
- IBD: Documents containing evidence or discussion related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
- Not IBD: Documents without any suggestive indications of IBD.

Built on a pretrained BERT architecture, this model leverages sequence classification techniques to identify IBD-related patterns in clinical narratives efficiently.
The model [`bert_sequence_classifier_ibd_onnx`](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2025/10/21/bert_sequence_classifier_ibd_onnx_en.html) is optimized for use with the compatible embeddings [`distil_ibd_bert_onnx`](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2025/10/21/distil_ibd_bert_onnx_en.html), ensuring high performance and efficiency in clinical text classification workflows.


*Example*:

```python
bfsc_loaded = BertForSequenceClassification.pretrained("bert_sequence_classifier_ibd_onnx", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(['document', 'token']) \
    .setOutputCol("label")

data = spark.createDataFrame([
    ["Patient with inflammatory bowel disease and colon inflammation."],
    ["Normal colonoscopy findings, no evidence of inflammation."],
]).toDF("text")

data = spark.createDataFrame([
    ["A 30-year-old man presents with chronic abdominal pain, fatigue, and intermittent diarrhea lasting several months. He reports 3–4 loose stools per day, often with postprandial cramping. Colonoscopy shows patchy ulceration and cobblestoning in the terminal ileum, while biopsies confirm chronic granulomatous inflammation. Labs reveal mild iron-deficiency anemia and elevated CRP. He is started on azathioprine and mesalamine, and receives dietary counseling on low-residue and high-protein intake."],
    ["A 49-year-old female presents with chronic constipation over several years. Colonoscopy is normal. Thyroid function, CRP, and electrolytes are within normal limits. She is diagnosed with chronic idiopathic constipation and started on polyethylene glycol and dietary fiber. No evidence of mucosal inflammation or IBD."],
]).toDF("text")
```

*Result for short text*:

{:.table-model-big}
|text                                                           |result   |

####  Introducing a New TextMatcher Model for ICD10CM Coding

A new TextMatcher model from John Snow Labs automatically maps clinical text to ICD10CM codes, making medical coding faster and more accurate. It streamlines documentation, reduces manual effort, and improves overall coding efficiency.

*Example*:

```python
text_matcher = TextMatcherInternalModel.pretrained("icd10cm_matcher", "en" ,"clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["document", "token"])\
    .setOutputCol("icd10cm")\
    .setMergeOverlapping(True)
