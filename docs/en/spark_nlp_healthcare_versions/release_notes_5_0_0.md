#### Introducing The Very First Few Shot Classifier Model To Our Toolkit To Train Classifier Models With Limited Labeled Data

The `FewShotClassifierApproach` and `FewShotClassifierModel` annotators are new additions to the set of annotators available in the Spark NLP for Healthcare library. These annotators specifically target few-shot classification tasks, which involve training a model to make accurate predictions with limited labeled data.

These new annotators provide a valuable capability for handling scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. By effectively utilizing limited labeled examples, the few-shot classification approach enables the creation of models that can generalize and classify new instances accurately, even with minimal training data.

In our experiment, we compared the Few-Shot Classifier trained on partial data, equivalent to 40% of our entire dataset, against the ClassifierDL trained on both full (80% of the dataset) and partial data. To maintain fairness, the test set was constant at 20% of the entire dataset for all cases, and the same sentence embeddings were employed across the board. The Few-Shot Classifier achieved a macro F1 score of 0.867, outperforming outperform that of the ClassifierDL using the full dataset, which scored a macro F1 score of 0.847. The ClassifierDL using partial data also showed comparable results to its full data counterpart, demonstrating its robustness with less training data, but it was still surpassed by the Few-Shot Classifier. This superior performance from the Few-Shot Classifier with less data signifies that it is highly efficient and effective, making it an excellent choice for scenarios where data scarcity is a concern. We're excited to see how this innovative feature will enhance the future of text classification tasks in our library. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to optimize and improve our offerings.

{:.table-model-big}
|                           | macro-f1-score | weighted-f1-score | accuracy  |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| ClassifierDL_full_Data    | 0.85       | 0.84        | 0.84  |
| ClassifierDL_partial_Data | 0.84       | 0.84        | 0.84  |
| FewShot_partial_Data      | 0.87       | 0.87        | 0.87  |

The `FewShotClassifier` is designed to process sentence embeddings as input. It generates category annotations, providing labels along with confidence scores that range from 0 to 1. Input annotation types supported by this model include `SENTENCE_EMBEDDINGS`, while the output annotation type is `CATEGORY`.


*Example*:

```python

few_shot_approach = FewShotClassifierApproach()\
    .setLabelColumn("label")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"])\
    .setOutputCol("prediction")\
    .setModelFile(f"/tmp/log_reg_graph.pb")\

    ["ADE_negative", 'I report a patient who developed the syndrome during treatment for schizophrenia with the antipsychotic agent molindone hydrochloride.']
]

model = pipeline.fit(train_data)

tests = [
    'Bleomycin pneumonitis potentiated by oxygen administration.',
    'Enzymes derived from two different bacterial sources (Escherichia coli and Erwinia carotovora) are in common use.',

text = """Low level of plasminogen increases risk for mortality in COVID-19 patients. The pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and especially of its complications is still not fully understood. In fact, a very high number of patients with COVID-19 die because of thromboembolic causes. A role of plasminogen, as precursor of fibrinolysis, has been hypothesized. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between plasminogen levels and COVID-19-related outcomes in a population of 55 infected Caucasian patients (mean age: 69.8 +/- 14.3, 41.8% female). Low levels of plasminogen were significantly associated with inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, and IL-6), markers of coagulation (D-dimer, INR, and APTT), and markers of organ dysfunctions (high fasting blood glucose and decrease in the glomerular filtration rate). A multidimensional analysis model, including the correlation of the expression of coagulation with inflammatory parameters, indicated that plasminogen tended to cluster together with IL-6, hence suggesting a common pathway of activation during disease's complication. Moreover, low levels of plasminogen strongly correlated with mortality in COVID-19 patients even after multiple adjustments for presence of confounding. These data suggest that plasminogen may play a pivotal role in controlling the complex mechanisms beyond the COVID-19 complications, and may be useful both as biomarker for prognosis and for therapeutic target against this extremely aggressive infection."""

#### New Feature To `InternalResourceDownloader` To Point Cache Folder

By setting the `cache_folder_path`, you can control where the downloaded resources are stored, enabling easy access and reuse of the downloaded models in subsequent operations or workflows.

*Example*:

```python
from sparknlp_jsl.pretrained import InternalResourceDownloader

#The first argument is the path to the zip file and the second one is the folder.
InternalResourceDownloader.downloadModelDirectly("clinical/models/ner_clinical_large_en_2.5.0_2.4_1590021302624.zip",
                                                 "clinical/models",
                                                 unzip=False,
                                                 cache_folder_path="/content")
```

#### `UpdateModels` Is Now More Flexible And Can Be Used To Update Existing Models In The Cache Folder

`UpdateModels` is a helper class that provides functionality to update existing pretrained models located in the cache folder. It offers two main methods: `updateCacheModels` and `updateModels`.

`UpdateModels.updateCacheModels(cache_folder='')`: This method refreshes all the pretrained models located in the cache pretrained folder.

`UpdateModels.updateModels()`: This method downloads all the new pretrained models that have been released since the specified date interval.

- `model_names`: A list of names of the models to be downloaded.
- `language`: The language of the models, with a default value of "en".
- `start_date`: The starting date used to filter the models, in the format "yyyy-MM-dd".
- `end_date`: The ending date used to filter the models, in the format "yyyy-MM-dd".
- `cache_folder`: The path indicating where the models will be downloaded and stored.

*Example*:

```python
from sparknlp_jsl.updateModels import UpdateModels

UpdateModels.updateModels(start_date = "2021-01-01",
                          end_date = "2023-07-07",
                          model_names=["ner_clinical","ner_jsl"],
                          language="en",
                          remote_loc="clinical/models",
                          cache_folder="/content/jsl_models"
                          )

ls /content/jsl_models/
```

*Result*:

```
ner_clinical_en_3.0.0_3.0_1617208419368/  
ner_jsl_en_4.2.0_3.0_1666181370373/

#### New Feature For `ChunkFilterer` To Enable Filtering Chunks According To Confidence Thresholds

We have added a new `setEntitiesConfidence` parameter to `ChunkFilterer` annotator that enables filtering the chunks according to the confidence thresholds. The only thing you need to do is provide a dictionary that has the NER labels as keys and the confidence thresholds as values.

*Example*:

```python
posology_ner = MedicalNerModel.pretrained("ner_posology", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("ner")

ner_converter = NerConverterInternal()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence","token","ner"])\
    .setOutputCol("posology_ner_chunk")

chunk_filterer = ChunkFilterer()\
    .setInputCols("sentence","posology_ner_chunk")\
    .setOutputCol("chunk_filtered")\
    .setFilterEntity("entity")\
    .setEntitiesConfidence({"DRUG":0.9,
                            "FREQUENCY":0.9,
                            "DOSAGE":0.9,
                            "DURATION":0.9,
                            "STRENGTH":0.9})


sample_text = 'The patient was prescribed 1 capsule of Advil for 5 days. He was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night.'  
```

*Detected chunks*:

#### Enhanced ALAB Module With Relation Extraction Model Training Data Preparation Ability Using Document-Level Annotations

In order to facilitate the preparation of document-level annotated data for training Relation Extraction models, we have introduced a new parameter called `doc_wise_annot` to the `get_relation_extraction_data` method in the ALAB module. By setting the `doc_wise_annot` parameter to `True`, the method will return the dataframe with sentence-cross annotations, if they exist. The default value is `False`.

*Example*:

```python
alab.get_relation_extraction_data(
    spark=spark,
    input_json_path='alab_demo.json',
    ground_truth=True,
    ...
    doc_wise_annot=True
