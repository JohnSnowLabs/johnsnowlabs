+ 3 new Entity Resolver models for associate clinical entities with RxNorm codes.
+ Introducing the new `LargeFewShotClassifierModel` annotator and 2 new classification models (age group detection and drug adverse event classification) that are trained with small datasets while achieving comparable performance to the models trained with larger datasets.
+ Introducing the `DocumentFiltererByNER` annotator to filter out the documents and sentences having certain types of named entities within the same pipeline.
+ Introducing a brand new `Mapper2Chunk` annotator to create a new chunk type from any mapper.
+ Introducing new `setConfidenceCalculationDirection` parameter for `ContextualAssertion` (rule-based context aware assertion status detection) to allow direction-sensitive confidence score calculation 
+ Introducing a new `dict_to_annotation_converter` module for converting dictionary data to Spark NLP annotations (e.g. allowing deidentification and obfuscation over a list of entities within a JSON format such as GenAI annotations)
+ New blog posts on identifying named entities in medical text with Zero-Shot learning
+ Various core improvements; bug fixes, enhanced overall robustness and reliability of Spark NLP for Healthcare
    - Enhanced metadata information with the `setMetadataFields` field for `AssertionChunkConverter`
    - Added new date format for deidentification
    - Added new parameters for the `Replacer` annotator to allow replacing any type of entities in a text with any other phrase or placeholder (e.g. replace all the drug generic names with drug brand names, etc.)
    - Added `document_id` info and confidence scores for `resolutions` and `assertions` fields to the `PipelineOutputParser` module
    - Resolved Flattener NullPointerException; if the column is empty, the Flattener returns empty columns instead of throwing an exception.
    - Resolved the AssertionMerger loading issue; an exception was thrown when attempting to load the AssertionMerger model.

**We recommend using 8b quantized versions of the models in a GPU-poor environment as the qualitative performance difference between q16 and q8 versions is very negligible.**

Note: Our current LLM loader implementation based on `llama.cpp` may lag behind when it comes to inference speed and output quality on certain use cases. We have other means of serving these models outside of the Healthcare NLP library and users are advised to get in touch with us if there is such a need. 

*Example*:

```python

from sparknlp_jsl.llm import LLMLoader

llm_loader_pretrained = LLMLoader(spark).pretrained("jsl_medm_q16_v2", "en", "clinical/models")

- `Carcinoma Type`: Cancers arising from epithelial cells, which are the most common type of cancer, including breast, lung, and colorectal carcinomas.
- `Leukemia Type`: Cancers of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the abnormal proliferation of white blood cells.
- `Lymphoma Type`: Cancers of the lymphatic system, affecting lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
- `Melanoma`: A type of skin cancer originating from melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment.
- `Sarcoma Type`: Cancers arising from connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or vascular tissues.
- `Metastasis`: Recognizes terms related to the spread of cancer to different parts of the body, including mentions of metastatic sites and related clinical descriptions.
- `Biomarker`: Extracts entities related to cancer biomarkers, including genetic markers, protein levels, and other measurable indicators used for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.
- `Biomarker_Quant`: Extracts numerical measurements or values associated with the biomarker.
- `Biomarker_Result`: Extracts descriptive or categorical assessments of the biomarker status.
- `Body Site`: Knowing the primary site of the tumor is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. The body site where the cancer originates often determines the type of cancer and influences therapeutic approaches.

sample_texts = """
Patient A, a 55-year-old female, presented with carcinoma in the left breast. A biopsy revealed an elevated HER2. The patient also showed a slightly elevated CA 15-3 level at 45 U/mL. Follow-up imaging revealed metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes, and further scans indicated small metastatic lesions in the liver.
Additionally, imaging of the patient's lower back indicated a possible sarcoma. Subsequent tests identified elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), with a result of 580 IU/L (normal range: 140-280 IU/L), and a biopsy confirmed metastasis to the lungs.
Routine bloodwork revealed a mild increase in B2M (Beta-2 microglobulin), suggestive of possible lymphoma, and a normal range for hemoglobin and white blood cells, ruling out leukemia. CNS involvement was ruled out as imaging did not indicate any anomalies.
For melanoma screening, a suspicious mole on the patient's arm was biopsied, and tests confirmed a BRAF V600E mutation. Further imaging revealed metastatic spread to the lungs and liver.

####  Introducing the New `LargeFewShotClassifierModel` Annotator and 2 New Classification Models (Age Group Detection and Drug Adverse Event Classification) That are Trained with Small Datasets While Achieving Comparable Performance to The Models Trained with Larger Datasets

The new LargeFewShotClassifierModel annotator  is designed to work effectively with minimal labeled data, offering flexibility and adaptability to new, unseen classes. Key parameters include batch size, case sensitivity, and maximum sentence length. The release includes two new classification models:

{:.table-model-big}

*Example*:

```python

large_few_shot_classifier = LargeFewShotClassifierModel()\
    .pretrained('large_fewshot_classifier_ade')\
    .setInputCols("document")\
    .setOutputCol("prediction")

#### Introducing `DocumentFiltererByNER` Annotator to Filter Out the Documents and Sentences Having Certain Types of Named Entities within the Same Pipeline

The `DocumentFiltererByNER` annotator returns sentences containing the entity chunks you have filtered, allowing you to see only the sentences with the entities you want. It is particularly useful for extracting and organizing the results obtained from Spark NLP Pipelines.

Key Parameters:

- `blackList`: If defined, list of entities to ignore. The rest will be processed.
- `whiteList`: If defined, list of entities to process. The rest will be ignored.
- `caseSensitive`: Determines whether the definitions of the white-listed and black-listed entities are case sensitive or not.
- `outputAsDocument`: Whether to return all sentences joined into a single document. (default: `False`).
- `joinString`: This parameter specifies the string that will be inserted between results of documents when combining them into a single result if outputAsDocument is set to `True` (default is: " ").


*Example*:

```python
filterer = medical.DocumentFiltererByNER() \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("filterer") \
    .setWhiteList(["Disease_Syndrome_Disorder"])\
    .setOutputAsDocument(True)\
    .setJoinString(" ")

#### Introducing a Brand New `Mapper2Chunk` Annotator to Create a New Chunk Type from any Mapper

The `Mapper2Chunk` annotator converts 'LABELED_DEPENDENCY' type annotations coming from ChunkMapper into 'CHUNK' type to create a new chunk-type column, compatible with annotators that use chunk type as input.

Key Parameter:
- `FilterNoneValues`: Whether to filter 'NONE' values. The default is `false`.


*Example*:

```python
ner_converter = NerConverterInternal() \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner"]) \
    .setOutputCol("ner_chunk")

chunkMapper = ChunkMapperModel.pretrained("drug_action_treatment_mapper", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("relations") \
    .setRels(["action"])

mapper2chunk = Mapper2Chunk() \
    .setInputCols(["relations"]) \
    .setOutputCol("chunk") \
    .setFilterNoneValues(True)

#### Introducing new `setConfidenceCalculationDirection` Parameter for `ContextualAssertion` (Rule Based Context-Aware Assertion Status Detection) to Allow Direction-Sensitive Confidence Score Calculation


The `setConfidenceCalculationDirection` parameter in the ContextualAssertion model allows users to specify the direction (left, right, or both) for calculating assertion confidence in clinical text analysis. By default, the direction is set to "left". This feature is easily configurable within the Spark NLP framework, providing more control over assertion confidence calculations.
 
*Example*:

```python
contextual_assertion = ContextualAssertion()\
            .setInputCols("sentence", "token", "ner_chunk") \
            .setOutputCol("assertion") \
            .setConfidenceCalculationDirection("both")

#### Introducing a New `dict_to_annotation_converter` Module for Converting Dictionary Data to Spark NLP Annotations (e.g. Allowing Deidentification and Obfuscation Over a List of Entities within a JSON Format such as GenAI Annotations)

This method converts a list of dictionaries into a Spark DataFrame with document and chunk columns compatible with Spark NLP for tasks like deidentification. The input data must include text and chunk information with specific attributes, such as start and end indices, entity types, and metadata. The method also allows customization of column names and an optional adjustment of chunk end indices.

*Example*:

```python
list_of_dict = [
    {
        "text": "My name is George, and I was born on 12/11/1995. I have the pleasure of working at John Snow Labs.",
        "chunks": [
            {
                "begin": 11,
                "end": 16,
                "result": "George",
                "entity": "PERSON",
                "metadata": {"confidence": "1", "ner_source": "ner_deid"}
            },
            {
                "begin": 37,
                "end": 46,
                "result": "12/11/1995",
                "entity": "DATE",
                "metadata": {"confidence": "0.9", "ner_source": "ner_deid"}
            },
            {
                "begin": 83,
                "end": 96,
                "result": "John Snow labs",
                "entity": "ORG",
                "metadata": {"confidence": "0.87", "ner_source": "ner_deid"}
            }
            ],
        "doc_id": "1",
        "file_path": "/path/to/file1"
    }
 ]
from sparknlp_jsl.annotator import LightDeIdentification
from sparknlp_jsl.utils import *

result_df = dict_to_annotation_converter(spark, list_of_dict)
result_df.select("doc_id", "text","chunk").show(truncate = 100)
```

*Result*:

{:.table-model-big}
|doc_id|       text|               chunk|
