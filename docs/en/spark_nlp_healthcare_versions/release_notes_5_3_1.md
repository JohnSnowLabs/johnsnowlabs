#### Enhancing Assertion Annotation Workflow with AssertionMerger Annotator to Allow using Multiple Assertion Models within the Same Pipeline.

Introducing the latest addition to our annotation toolkit, the AssertionMerger Annotator, designed to streamline the merging process of assertion columns from various annotators like AssertionDL and AssertionLogReg. This powerful tool offers customizable parameters for filtering, prioritizing, and seamlessly combining assertion annotations. Learn how to leverage features like merging overlapping annotations, applying filters before or after merging, and prioritizing based on confidence levels and assertion sources. Optimize your annotation workflow with AssertionMerger Annotator, ensuring efficient and accurate consolidation of assertion data.


**Parameters:**

- `mergeOverlapping`: Whether to merge overlapping matched assertion annotations. Default: `True`
- `applyFilterBeforeMerge`: Whether to apply filtering before the merging process. If `True`, filtering will be applied before merging; if `False`, filtering will be applied after the merging process. Default: `False`.
- `blackList`: If defined, list of entities to ignore. The rest will be processed.
- `whiteList`: If defined, list of entities to process. The rest will be ignored. Do not include the IOB prefix on labels.
- `caseSensitive`: Determines whether the definitions of the white-listed and black-listed entities are case sensitive. Default: `True`.
- `assertionsConfidence`: Pairs (assertion, confidenceThreshold) to filter assertions that have confidence lower than the confidence threshold.
- `orderingFeatures`: Specifies the ordering features to use for overlapping entities. Possible values include: 'begin', 'end', 'length', 'source', and 'confidence'. Default: `['begin', 'length', 'source']`
- `selectionStrategy`: Determines the strategy for selecting annotations. Annotations can be selected either sequentially based on their order (Sequential) or using a more diverse strategy (DiverseLonger). Currently, only Sequential and DiverseLonger options are available. Default: `Sequential`.
- `defaultConfidence`:  When the confidence value is included in the orderingFeatures and a given annotation does not have any confidence, this parameter determines the value to be used. The default value is `0`.
- `assertionSourcePrecedence`: Specifies the assertion sources to use for prioritizing overlapping annotations when the 'source' ordering feature is utilized. This parameter contains a comma-separated list of assertion sources that drive the prioritization. Annotations will be prioritized based on the order of the given string.
- `sortByBegin`: Whether to sort the annotations by begin at the end of the merge and filter process. Default: `False`.


*Example*:

```python
# Assertion model trained on i2b2 (sampled from MIMIC) dataset
assertion_jsl = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_jsl_augmented", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_jsl_chunk", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("assertion_jsl")\
    .setEntityAssertionCaseSensitive(False)

# Assertion model trained on radiology dataset
assertion_dl = AssertionDLModel.pretrained("assertion_dl", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "ner_clinical_chunk", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("assertion_dl")

assertion_merger = AssertionMerger() \
    .setInputCols("assertion_jsl", "assertion_dl") \
    .setOutputCol("assertion_merger") \
    .setMergeOverlapping(True) \
    .setSelectionStrategy("sequential") \
    .setAssertionSourcePrecedence("assertion_dl, assertion_jsl") \
    .setCaseSensitive(False) \
    .setAssertionsConfidence({"past": 0.70}) \
    .setOrderingFeatures(["length", "source", "confidence"]) \
    .setDefaultConfidence(0.50)

He denies any intent to harm himself, although his parents confirm past suicidal attempts. On Monday, he felt he was experiencing a Percocet withdrawal "hangover" and took an additional 5 Percocet. He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) and received care from Liver, Transplant, Toxicology. Treatment included Naloxone every 4 hours, resulting in a gradual improvement in liver function tests (LFTs) and INR. During recovery, he developed hypertension and was initiated on clonidine."""

#### `DatasetInfo` Parameter Added to `SentenceEntityResolver` Annotator to Track the Source Datasets' Versions.

Introduced a setDatasetInfo param to SentenceEntityResolverApproach annotator to let users add dataset information (version, year, etc.) to the "model metadata" not the output.

*Example:*

```python
bertExtractor = SentenceEntityResolverApproach()\
  .setNeighbours(25)\
  .setThreshold(1000)\
  .setInputCols("bert_embeddings")\
  .setNormalizedCol("concept_name")\
  .setLabelCol("conceptId")\
  .setOutputCol('snomed_code')\
  .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDIAN")\
  .setCaseSensitive(False)\
  .setDatasetInfo("the model version:531")
```

#### Robust Exception Handling to Allow Skipping only the Corrupted Records Processed via `GenericClassifier`, `BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings`, `AssertionFilterer`, `ChunkFilterer`, `ContextualParser`, `ChunkMerge` and `Deidentification` Annotators

We added the `doExceptionHandling` parameter into `GenericClassifier`, `BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings`, `AssertionFilterer`, `ChunkFilterer`, `ContextualParser`, `ChunkMerge` and `Deidentification` annotators for a robust exception handling if the process is broken down due to corrupted inputs. Suppose it is set as `True`. In that case, the annotator tries to process as usual and if exception-causing data (e.g. corrupted record/ document) is passed to the annotator, an exception warning is emitted which has the exception message. **Processing continues with the next one** while the rest of the records within the same batch are parsed without interruption. The default behavior is `False` and will throw an exception and break the process to inform users.

*Example*:

```python
deidentification = DeIdentification() \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("deidentified") \
    .setMode("mask")\
    .setDoExceptionHandling(True)
```

#### Changed the license of  CPT and MedDRA Models in the ModelHub, and Attempting to Use Them in Healthcare NLP now Throws an Error

The CPT and MedDRA models have been removed from the S3 storage. As a result, when attempting to use these models in Spark NLP, a new error message is thrown. The new error message states that the specified model (e.g., 'aaa') cannot be used as a pre-trained model. It further explains that to load the model locally using the .load() method, possession of a valid MedDRA or CPT license is required. If the user has such a license obtained through the corresponding agencies, they are instructed to contact the support team at support@johnsnowlabs.com to inquire about using the model.
