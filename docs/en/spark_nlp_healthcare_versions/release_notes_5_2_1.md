#### Introducing A New Opioid Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model For Extracting Information Regarding `Opioid` Usage
This model is designed to detect and label opioid-related entities within text data. Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and pain relievers available legally by prescription. The model has been trained using advanced deep-learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources and can accurately recognize and classify a wide range of opioid-related entities.
The model’s accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results.

Please see the model card [ner_opioid_small_wip](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2024/01/11/ner_opioid_small_wip_en.html) for more information about the model

*Example*:

```python
ner_model = MedicalNerModel.pretrained("ner_opioid_small_wip", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"])\
    .setOutputCol("ner")

####  Returning Text Embeddings Within Sentence Entity Resolution Models

The unique aspect highlighted in this implementation is the use of the `setReturnResolvedTextEmbeddings` parameter. By setting it to `True`, the code allows for the inclusion of embeddings for resolved text candidates, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and understanding of the resolved entities within the clinical text. This parameter provides flexibility by allowing users to either include or exclude embeddings based on their requirements, with the default setting being `False`.


*Example*:

```python
rxnorm_resolver = SentenceEntityResolverModel.pretrained("sbiobertresolve_rxnorm_augmented", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("rxnorm_code")\
    .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDEAN")\
    .setReturnResolvedTextEmbeddings(True)

text = 'metformin 100 mg'
```

*Result*:

|            text|                                                                                          embeddings|

#### Setting Entity Pairs For Relation Labels Feature In `RelationExtractionDLModel` to Reduce False Positives

`RelationExtractionDLModel` now includes the ability to set entity pairs for each relation label, giving you more control over your results and even greater accuracy.

In the following example, we utilize entity pair restrictions to limit the results of Relation Extraction labels solely to relations that exist between specified entities, thus improving the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data. If we don't set the `setRelationTypePerPair` parameter here, the REDL model may return different RE labels for these specified entities.

*Example*:

```python
clinical_re_Model = RelationExtractionDLModel().pretrained('redl_clinical_biobert', "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["re_ner_chunks", "sentence"]) \
    .setOutputCol("relations")\
    .setRelationPairsCaseSensitive(False)\
    .setRelationTypePerPair({"TrAP": ["PROBLEM-TREATMENT"],
                             "TrIP": ["TREATMENT-PROBLEM"],
                             "TrWP": ["TREATMENT-PROBLEM"],
                             "TrCP": ["TREATMENT-PROBLEM"],
                             "TrAP": ["TREATMENT-PROBLEM"],
                             "TrNAP":["TREATMENT-PROBLEM"],
                             "TeCP": ["PROBLEM-TEST"],
                             "TeRP": ["PROBLEM-TEST"],
                             "PIP":  ["PROBLEM-PROBLEM"]
                             })

text ="""She was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG .
She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation. Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity .
Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L .
Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission .
However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L .
The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again .
The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use .
The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , and metformin 1000 mg two times a day . It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely . She had close follow-up with endocrinology post discharge .

#### Cluster and CPU Speed Benchmark for Chunk Mapper, Entity Resolver, and Deidentification Pipelines

Dive into the heart of healthcare data processing with our benchmark experiment meticulously designed for Mapper, Resolver, and Deidentification Pipelines. This benchmark provides crucial insights into the performance of these pipelines under varied configurations and dataset conditions.

Cluster configuration:
  - Driver Name: Standard_DS3_v2
  - Driver Memory: 14GB
  - Worker Name: Standard_DS3_v2
  - Worker Memory: 14GB
  - Worker Cores: 4
  - Action: write_parquet
  - Total Worker Numbers: 10
  - Total Cores: 40

These figures might differ based on the size of the mapper and resolver models. The larger the models, the higher the inference times. Depending on the success rate of mappers (any chunk coming in caught by the mapper successfully), the combined mapper and resolver timing would be less than resolver-only timing.

If the resolver-only timing is equal to or very close to the combined mapper and resolver timing, it means that the mapper is not capable of catching/ mapping any chunk. In that case, try playing with various parameters in the mapper or retrain/ augment the mapper.

- Mapper and Resolver Benchmark Experiment

**Dataset:** 100 Clinical Texts from MTSamples, approx. 705 tokens and 11 chunks per text.
