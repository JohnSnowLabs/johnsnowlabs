#### `Text2SQL` module to translate text prompts into accurate SQL queries

We are excited to introduce our latest innovation, the `Text2SQL` annotator. This powerful tool revolutionizes the way you interact with databases by effortlessly translating natural language text prompts into accurate and effective SQL queries. With the integration of a state-of-the-art LLM, this annotator opens new possibilities for enhanced data retrieval and manipulation, streamlining your workflow and boosting efficiency. 

Also we have a new `text2sql_mimicsql` model that is specifically finetuned on MIMIC-III dataset schema for enhancing the precision of SQL queries derived from medical natural language queries on MIMIC dataset. Please check the [model card](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/08/14/text2sql_mimicsql_en.html) for more details.


*Example*:

```python
text2sql = Text2SQL.pretrained("text2sql_mimicsql", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["document"])\
    .setOutputCol("sql")

sample_text = "Calulate the total number of patients who had icd9 code 5771"
```

*Results:*

{:.table-model-big}
|SQL Query|
|-|
|SELECT COUNT ( DISTINCT DEMOGRAPHIC."SUBJECT_ID" ) FROM DEMOGRAPHIC INNER JOIN PROCEDURES on DEMOGRAPHIC.HADM_ID = PROCEDURES.HADM_ID WHERE PROCEDURES."ICD9_CODE" = "5771"|

Please check: [Text to SQL Generation Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/37.Text2SQL_Generation.ipynb) for more information

#### Text Classifier Models to Infer `Age Groups` from Health Records, Even in the Absence of Explicit Age Indications or Mentions.

Now we have three new Age Group Text Classifier models that are designed to analyze the age group of individuals mentioned in health documents, whether or not the age is explicitly mentioned in the training data. These models are trained using in-house annotated health-related text, and categorized into three classes:

- **Adult**: Refers to individuals who are fully grown or developed, usually 18 years or older.
- **Child**: A young human who is not yet an adult. Typically refers to someone below the legal age of adulthood, which is often below 18 years old.
- **Unknown**: Represents situations where determining the age group from the given text is not possible.
