#### Multi-mode Deidentification And Obfuscation Support In A Single Pass With The Streamlined Deid Module

We are proud to announce the enhancement of our Deid module with the introduction of a one-pass, multi-mode deidentification feature. This powerful new capability significantly improves the module's functionality, enabling users to deidentify their data with increased efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility.

To utilize this feature for a single column, simply set the `multi_mode_file_path` parameter with the JSON file path describing the desired multi-mode configuration. This streamlined approach demonstrates our commitment to providing state-of-the-art tools that cater to the evolving needs of healthcare professionals and researchers, ensuring the protection of sensitive information while maintaining data utility for analysis and decision-making.

*Example*:

```python
#json to choose deid mode
sample_json= {
	"obfuscate": ["NAME", "PHONE"] ,
	"mask_entity_labels": ["AGE"],
	"skip": ["SSN"],
	"mask_same_length_chars":["DATE"],
	"mask_fixed_length_chars":["ZIP", "LOCATION"]
}

import json
with open('sample_multi-mode.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(sample_json, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)

#Deidentification with multi mode for one column
deid_implementor= Deid(spark,
                       input_file_path="deid_data.csv",
                       output_file_path="deidentified.csv",
                       custom_pipeline=model,
                       multi_mode_file_path="sample_multi-mode.json")
                       
```


For multiple columns, we can set one specific JSON file path multi mode for each column.

*Example*:

```python
#json to choose deid mode for the 2nd column
sample_json_column2= {
	"obfuscate": ["SSN", "AGE"] ,
	"mask_entity_labels": ["DATE"],
	"skip": ["ID"],
	"mask_same_length_chars":["NAME"],
	"mask_fixed_length_chars":["ZIP", "LOCATION"]
}

import json
with open('sample_multi-mode_column2.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(sample_json_column2, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)

#Deidentification with multi mode for multiple columns
deid_implementor= Deid(spark,
                       input_file_path="deid_multiple_data.csv",
                       output_file_path="deidentified.csv",
