####  Introducing the Advanced `Medical Document Splitter` Annotator with More Flexibility and Customization for RAG Pipelines

Discover our cutting-edge Internal Document Splitterâ€”an innovative annotator designed to effortlessly break down extensive documents into manageable segments. Empowering users with the ability to define custom separators, this tool seamlessly divides texts, ensuring each chunk adheres to specified length criteria.

InternalDocumentSplitter has a setSplitMode method to decide how to split documents. Default: 'regex'. It should be one of the following values:
- `char`: Split text based on individual characters.
- `token`: Split text based on tokens. You should supply tokens from inputCols.
- `sentence`: Split text based on sentences. You should supply sentences from inputCols.
- `recursive`: Split text recursively using a specific algorithm.
- `regex`: Split text based on a regular expression pattern.

*Example*:

```python
document_splitter = InternalDocumentSplitter()\
    .setInputCols("document")\
    .setOutputCol("splits")\
    .setSplitMode("recursive")\
    .setChunkSize(100)\
    .setChunkOverlap(3)\
    .setExplodeSplits(True)\
    .setPatternsAreRegex(False)\
    .setSplitPatterns(["\n\n", "\n", " "])\
    .setKeepSeparators(False)\
    .setTrimWhitespace(True)

text = [( 
    "The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery"
    " nearly one year ago. \nHe has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well"
    " until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain," 
    " which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it"
    " but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3." 
    " \n\nHe denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday." 
    " He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum." 
)]
```

#### Enhancing `ChunkFiltererApproach` by Introducing JSON-Based Entity Confidence Configuration

The new `setEntitiesConfidenceResourceAsJsonString` method allows users to finely tune entity confidence levels using a JSON configuration.

*Example*:

```python
chunk_filterer = ChunkFiltererApproach()\
    .setInputCols("sentence","ner_chunk")\
    .setOutputCol("chunk_filtered")\
    .setFilterEntity("entity")\
    .setEntitiesConfidenceResourceAsJsonString("""{'DURATION':'0.9',
                                                  'DOSAGE':'0.9',
                                                  'FREQUENCY':'0.9',
                                                  'STRENGTH':'0.9',
                                                  'DRUG':'0.9'}""")

text ='The patient was prescribed 1 capsule of Advil for 5 days . He was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , metformin 1000 mg two times a day . It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely fro 3 months .'
```

#### Advanced Data Privacy with DeIdentification Unleashing Regex Patterns Unleashed

The latest update in the DeIdentification library brings advanced data privacy with the introduction of the setRegexPatternsDictionaryAsJsonString method. This powerful feature empowers users to create custom regular expression patterns for masking specific protected entities. 

*Example*:

```python
deid = DeIdentification()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("deidentified") \
    .setMode("mask") \
    .setRegexPatternsDictionaryAsJsonString("{'NUMBER':'\d+'},"+
                                            "{'NUMBER':'(\d+.?\d+.?\d+)'}")\
    .setRegexOverride(True) # Prioritizing regex rules

text ='''
Record date : 2093-01-13 , David Hale , M.D . , Name : Hendrickson Ora , MR # 7194334 Date : 01/13/93 . PCP : Oliveira , 25 years-old , Record date : 2079-11-09 . Cocke County Baptist Hospital , Keats Street , ZIP 45662, Phone 55-555-5555 .
'''
```

*Without RegexOverride Results (default regex)*:

```bash
[Record date : <DATE> , David Hale , M.D ., , Name : Hendrickson Ora ,  Date : <DATE> ., PCP : Oliveira , 25 years-old , Record date : <DATE> ., Cocke County Baptist Hospital , Keats Street , ZIP 45662, Phone <PHONE> .]
```
 
*With RegexOverride Results (custom regex)*:

```bash
[Record date : <NUMBER> , David Hale , M.D ., , Name : Hendrickson Ora ,  Date : <NUMBER> ., PCP : Oliveira , <NUMBER> years-old , Record date : <NUMBER> ., Cocke County Baptist Hospital , Keats Street , ZIP <NUMBER>, Phone <NUMBER> .]
```

- Merging default regex rules and custom user-defined regex with `setCombineRegexPatterns`

*Example*:

```python
deid = DeIdentification()\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"]) \
    .setOutputCol("deidentified") \
    .setMode("mask") \
    .setCombineRegexPatterns(True)\
    .setRegexPatternsDictionary("./custom_regex.txt")
```

####  Robust Exception Handling in `MedicalNerModel` for Corrupted Inputs

Enhance the resilience of your Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) model with the ExceptionHandling feature. When the `setDoExceptionHandling` is set to true, the model attempts to compute batch-wise as usual. In the event of an exception within a batch, the system switches to row-wise processing. Any exception during row processing results in the emission of an Error Annotation, ensuring that only the problematic rows are lost rather than the entire batch. 

*Example*:

```python
clinical_ner = MedicalNerModel.pretrained("ner_oncology", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("ner")\
    .setDoExceptionHandling(True)
```
