#### Calculate the Embeddings of the Neighboring Context of a Named Entity (not just the chunk) with the `BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings` Annotator for Improved Context Awareness

The `BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings` annotator now includes advanced features and expanded support for ONNX models:
- `strategy`: Defines how embeddings are computed, with the following options:
	- "sentence_average": Average of sentence and chunk embeddings.
	- "scope_average": Average of scope (defined by scopeWindow) and chunk embeddings.
	- "chunk_only": Embeddings based solely on chunks.
	- "scope_only": Embeddings based solely on scope (requires scopeWindow).
- `scopeWindow`: Specifies the range of tokens used for scope embeddings, which are defined as two non-negative integers. The first integer indicates tokens before the chunk, and the second indicates tokens after. The default is (0, 0), meaning only chunk embeddings are used.
- ONNX Model Support: The annotator now supports ONNX models, enabling integration with models.

*Example*:

```python
chunk_only_embeddings = BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings.pretrained("sbiobert_base_cased_mli", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"])\
    .setOutputCol("sentence_embeddings")\
    .setCaseSensitive(False)\
    .setChunkWeight(0.5)\
    .setStrategy("chunk_only")

scope_average_embeddings = BertSentenceChunkEmbeddings.pretrained("sbiobert_base_cased_mli", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols(["sentence", "token", "ner_chunk"])\
    .setOutputCol("sentence_embeddings")\
    .setCaseSensitive(False)\
    .setChunkWeight(0.5)\
    .setStrategy("scope_average")\
    .setScopeWindow([5,5])

icd_resolver = SentenceEntityResolverModel.pretrained("sbiobertresolve_icd10cm_augmented_billable_hcc","en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("icd10cm_code")\
    .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDEAN")

text = """he patient is a 42-year-old female and has diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy since four years and she was treated by Center Hospital."""
```

#### De-identifying Sensitive Data in Relational Databases with a Few Lines of Codes

The RelationalDBDeidentification class provides a robust solution for de-identifying sensitive data in relational databases. It supports a variety of obfuscation techniques and integrates seamlessly with database systems. Key features include:

- End-to-End De-Identification:
	- deidentify(): Automates the de-identification process by:
        - Fetching tables.
        - Extracting schema information.
        - Detecting sensitive columns.
        - Applying obfuscation and masking techniques.
        - Exporting de-identified data as CSV files.
- Database Connectivity:
	- connect_to_db(): Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
	- get_all_tables(): Retrieves all table names from the connected database.
- Schema and Data Processing:
	- get_schema_info(table_name): Extracts schema details, including date columns, primary keys, and foreign keys, for a specified table.
- Data Obfuscation:
	- obfuscate_dates(df, date_columns): Shifts dates by a specified number of days.
	- obfuscate_ages(df, age_columns, use_hipaa): Obfuscates age columns using HIPAA rules or predefined age groups.
	- mask_other_sensitive_columns(df, other_columns): Masks sensitive columns by replacing their values with asterisks.
 
This class provides a complete framework for protecting sensitive information while maintaining data integrity for relational databases.

*Example*:

```python
from sparknlp_jsl.utils.database_deidentification import RelationalDBDeidentification

config = {
    "db_config": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "user": "root",

#### Reduce False Positives Returned by NER Models via Possible and Impossible Context Using `ContextualEntityFilterer`. This also Refines Entity Extraction by Leveraging Regex-Based Contextual Filtering 

The `ContextualEntityFilterer` now includes two new parameters, `possibleRegexContext` and `impossibleRegexContext`, providing advanced filtering options for contextual entity recognition. These parameters offer granular control for refining entity extraction by leveraging regex-based contextual filtering.
- `possibleRegexContext`: The possible regex context to filter the chunks. If the regex is found in the context(chunk), the chunk is kept.
- `impossibleRegexContext`: The impossible regex context to filter the chunks. If the regex is found in the context(chunk), the chunk is removed.
Important Note: When defining regex patterns in code, use double escape characters (e.g., \\) to ensure proper handling of special characters.

*Example*:

```python
 contextual_entity_filterer = ContextualEntityFilterer() \
	.setInputCols("sentence", "token", "ner_chunks") \
	.setOutputCol("filtered_ner_chunks") \
	.setRules([{
		"entity": "AGE",
		"scopeWindow": [3, 3],                
		"scopeWindowLevel": "token",
		"impossibleRegexContext" : "\\b(1[2-9]\\d|[2-9]\\d{2,}|\\d{4,})\\b"
	}])\
	.setRuleScope("sentence")\
	.setCaseSensitive(False)

text = "California, known for its beautiful beaches,and he is 366 years old. " \
        "The Grand Canyon in Arizona,  where the age is 37, is a stunning natural landmark." \
        "It was founded on September 9, 1850, and Arizona on February 14, 1912."
```


*Result*:

```bash

#### Enhace Named Entities with Specific Keywords by Allowing Greater Control Over Pattern Matching via `ContextualEntityRuler`

The `ContextualEntityRuler` has been updated with a new parameter, `allowTokensInBetween`, to enhance matching flexibility and address a bug in `exclude` mode's begin indexes:
- `allowTokensInBetween`: When `True`: Allows tokens between prefix/suffix patterns and the entity, enabling extended matches. When `False`: Tokens between patterns and entities prevent a match. Default: False
- adding the "replace_label_only" option to the `mode` parameter
  
This update provides greater control over pattern matching while ensuring robust performance in entity recognition workflows.

*Example*:

```python
rules = [
	{
		"entity": "Age",
		"scopeWindow" : [15,15],
		"scopeWindowLevel" : "char",
		"suffixPatterns" : ["years old", "year old", "months"],
		"replaceEntity": "Modified_Age",
		"mode": "exclude"
	},
	{
		"entity": "Diabetes",
		"scopeWindow" : [3,3],
		"scopeWindowLevel"  : "token",
		"suffixPatterns" : ["complications"],
		"replaceEntity": "Modified_Diabetes",
		"mode": "include"
	},
	{
		"entity": "NAME",
		"scopeWindow" : [3,3],
		"scopeWindowLevel" : "token",
		"prefixPatterns" : ["MD", "M.D", "Dr"],
		"replaceEntity": "Doctor_Name",
		"mode": "replace_only_labels"
	}   
]

contextual_entity_ruler = ContextualEntityRuler() \
            .setInputCols("sentence", "token", "ner_chunk") \
            .setOutputCol("ruled_ner_chunk") \
            .setRules(rules) \
            .setCaseSensitive(False)\
            .setDropEmptyChunks(True)\
            .setAllowPunctuationInBetween(False)\
            .setAllowTokensInBetween(True)

#### 10 New `PretrainedZeroShotNER` Named Entity Recognition Models that are Already Finetuned on In-house Annotations

Pretrained-Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) enables the identification of entities in text with minimal effort. By leveraging pre-trained language models and contextual understanding, zero-shot NER extends entity recognition capabilities to new domains and languages.
While the model card includes default labels as examples, it is important to highlight that users are not limited to these labels. The model is designed to support any set of entity labels, allowing users to adapt it to their specific use cases. For best results, it is recommended to use labels that are conceptually similar to the provided defaults.

text = """"The CFTR gene, situated on chromosome 7, encodes a chloride channel protein crucial for epithelial salt and water regulation. This gene is associated with cystic fibrosis, demonstrating autosomal recessive inheritance. Mutations like the classic ÎF508 (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508) significantly impair protein folding and cellular transport. The gene shows incomplete penetrance, with variable clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory complications to severe multi-organ dysfunction. Diagnostic approaches include genetic testing, sweat chloride analysis, and pulmonary function assessments. Treatment modalities have evolved, incorporating targeted therapies like CFTR modulators that address specific molecular defects. Gene interactions with environmental factors and modifier genes influence disease progression and severity. Prevalence is notably higher in populations of Northern European descent, with approximately 1 in 2,500-3,500 live births affected.
The FMR1 gene, located on the X chromosome, is critical in neurological development and synaptic function. This gene is associated with Fragile X syndrome, exhibiting X-linked dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Molecular characterization reveals CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions causing potential intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental challenges. Penetrance is complex, with males typically more severely affected than females due to X-chromosome inactivation patterns. Clinical presentations include developmental delays, characteristic facial features, and potential autism spectrum disorder associations. Diagnostic strategies involve molecular genetic testing to quantify CGG repeat expansions. Treatment approaches are multidisciplinary, focusing on educational interventions, behavioral therapies, and management of associated neurological symptoms. Environmental interactions and epigenetic modifications significantly influence phenotypic expressions."""

The ATP7B gene provides instructions for a copper-transporting ATPase essential for copper homeostasis. Mutations in the ATP7B gene cause Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. 
Over 500 mutations have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations. The variant ATP7B protein leads to impaired copper excretion and accumulation in various organs, particularly the liver and brain. 
Clinical presentations of Wilson disease include hepatic dysfunction, neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors, dystonia), and psychiatric disturbances. 
Kayser-Fleischer rings, copper deposits in the cornea, are a characteristic sign. Gene-environment interactions are significant, with dietary copper intake and other environmental factors influencing disease progression. 
Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical symptoms, low serum ceruloplasmin, high urinary copper, and genetic testing. 
Treatment focuses on reducing copper accumulation through chelation therapy with drugs like penicillamine or trientine, and zinc supplementation to block copper absorption. 
Liver transplantation may be necessary in severe cases. The worldwide prevalence of Wilson disease is estimated at 1 in 30,000, with higher rates in certain isolated populations.

#### Updated Human Phenotype Ontology Resolver Model

This model maps phenotypic abnormalities, medical terms associated with hereditary diseases, encountered in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes using sbiobert_base_cased_mli Sentence Bert Embeddings, and has faster load time, with a speedup of about 6X when compared to previous versions. Also, the load process now is more memory friendly meaning that the maximum memory required during load time is smaller, reducing the chances of OOM exceptions, and thus relaxing hardware requirements

`This model returns Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes for phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. It also returns associated codes from the following vocabularies for each HPO code: - SNOMEDCT_US - UMLS (Unified Medical Language System ) - ORPHA (international reference resource for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs) - EPCC (European Paediatric Cardiac Code - another region-specific or discipline-specific coding system related to healthcare or medical classification) - Fyler (unique identifier used within a specific coding system or database)`

*Example*:

```python

resolver = SentenceEntityResolverModel.pretrained("sbiobertresolve_HPO", "en", "clinical/models") \
    .setInputCols(["sentence_embeddings"]) \
    .setOutputCol("hpo")\
    .setDistanceFunction("EUCLIDEAN")
