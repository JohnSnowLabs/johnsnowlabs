In this example, you can notice a conversation focused on dry eye disease, starting with a general inquiry. `John` explains what the disease consists of and highlights its symptoms with references from recent literature. If users ask follow-up questions, the `John` can put those into context and understand it has to provide treatment options for the disease mentioned in the previous interactions. Users can also refer to parts of the previous responses to ask for more details. In the above example, I asked for more info on point 7. `John` understands point seven refers to hydrogels and nanosystems and gives an overview on their usage for DED and of their advantages. 

With this chatbot, you can expect a seamless conversational experience, where the flow of information is as natural and intuitive as a discussion with a trusted colleague.

## Explainable Responses with Citations

In the field of healthcare, the precision and source of data hold paramount importance. To address this, our medical chatbot has been engineered to offer more than simple information snippets in response to medical inquiries. It serves as a portal to the underlying research from which its answers are derived. This level of transparency is attained through the chatbot's unique citation feature.
The chatbot leverages a constantly updated knowledge graph for its responses, sourced from an extensive array of medical texts. Primary knowledge bases like Pubmed and Medrxiv are refreshed daily, ensuring the provision of the latest information to our users. The chatbot's replies are grounded in data from this knowledge graph, referencing peer-reviewed articles, clinical databases, or user-specific custom KBs. This approach guarantees traceability of information and significantly reduces the occurrence of false or misleading information. This functionality not only adds depth and context to the responses but also aligns with the standards of academic research and evidence-based practice.

## Summarize Medical Content

In the medical domain, where information is as rich as it is overwhelming, the ability to distill complex content into concise, digestible summaries can prove very convenient. John addresses this challenge head-on, employing advanced language processing to extract key points from lengthy medical texts, research papers, and clinical guidelines, presenting them in a clear and succinct format.


<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmVhywsT8I?si=ahwCxxG0gx8SnTOp&hd=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


In the example above you can notice how the chatbot can take a dense, multi-page document and within moments, offer you a 3 sentence summary that captures the essence of the material. It can highlight the most pertinent information, so you can quickly grasp the salient points without wading through the entire text.
The summary feature is more than a simple truncation of text; it is an intelligent synthesis that understands the context, retains critical details, and omits the less essential ones, ensuring that the heart of the content is preserved and made more accessible.
Whether for academic purposes, patient care, or personal edification, this summarization tool is crafted to save time, reduce cognitive load, and enhance understanding. It empowers healthcare professionals to stay informed and focused, freeing up precious time for the human aspect of medicineâ€”patient interaction.

## Create Custom Knowledge Bases

Recognizing the diverse needs of medical practices and research domains, the Medical Chatbot allows users to create custom knowledge bases from their private document collections - be they research papers, clinical trial data, or institutional records. For this, `John` applies state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to understand your documents and to create intelligent knowledge repositories tailored to your unique informational ecosystem. By building a custom knowledge base, you gain a tool that speaks directly to your needs, understands your specific medical dialect, and provides rapid, pinpoint access to the information you rely on. 
This video details the steps for creating a custom knowledge base. 

<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiSJo0kwxE8?si=MzpEX4QQ7PlElmDm&hd=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

First, the user defines a name for the Knowledge Base and provides a link to an s3 bucket where the target documents reside as well as access credentials to the data. A quick preview of the files located in the s3 bucket is shown so the users can check that the provided bucket is the correct one. After this validation, the ingestion process starts. Currently, the chatbot can process TXT and PDF files.

Once the KB is in place, you can define access permissions with granularity, ensuring that relevant teams, departments, or research groups within your organization can connect with the precise data they need, when they need it, under the governance protocols you set. As such, the medical chatbot ensures that sensitive information remains secure, while still being readily accessible to authorized personnel, thereby enhancing collaboration without compromising confidentiality.

## Ask About Your Own Patients
In the practice of medicine, each patient has a unique narrative, a confluence of history, symptoms, and treatment responses. Usually, this data is presented in an unstructured natural language format. By integrating custom knowledge bases containing patient data, healthcare professionals can ask `John` for detailed insights into patient's medical histories, treatment plans, and progress notes. This capability is governed by strict authentication protocols, ensuring that sensitive patient information remains confidential and accessible only to authorized personnel.

Furthermore, you can easily access the paragraphs used to compile the answers to get more details about the patients and even go back to the source document for further investigation.
