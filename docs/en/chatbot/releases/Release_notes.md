2. **Customizable Accessibility**
   - Users can enable or disable NLP tools based on their specific needs or preferences, allowing for a personalized experience and control over the processing features used.
3. **Accessing Tools**
   - NLP tools can be invoked in two ways: via regular queries in natural language or by using the '@' operator for direct tool activation.
   - Typing '@' at the beginning of the query box triggers a contextual menu displaying all available tools, similar to tagging functionality in Microsoft Teams.
   - The @ operator also allows direct access to `MedResearch` and `Wikipedia` tools for targeted questions. For instance, when using `@medical_research` at the beginning of your question, the chatbot will directly engage the `MedResearch` tool without requiring the user to select from multiple options, ensuring a streamlined interaction for focused research tasks.
   - Similarly, for Wikipedia and NLP Tools, each tool can be easily selected and utilized with the @ operator as follows:
       - `@search_wikipedia`: Query Wikipedia Pages
       - `@deidentification`: De-identification of Medical Text
       - `@obfuscation`: Obfuscation of Medical Text
       - `@ner_medical`: General Medical Entity Extraction
       - `@ner_medical_oncology `: Oncological Entity Extraction
       - `@ner_medical_posology `: Posology Entity Extraction
   - When interacting with the chatbot, the generated answer prominently displays the tool used for response generation right above the answer itself. This clarification ensures users know which tool was utilized.
   - Similarly, when selecting a specific tool using the '@' Selector in your query, the chosen tool is labeled at the top of the query, making it clear which tool was requested for the response generation.
   - Hence, users can better understand the specialties of these tools and experiment to obtain the best possible responses according to their needs.

## Introducing Contextual Follow-up Question Suggestions

In our latest update, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to the user interaction experience within the Medical Chatbot. This new feature aims to enrich the dialogue between the user and the chatbot, providing a more engaging and seamless information exchange.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Follow-up Question Suggestions

After the Medical Chatbot generates a response to a user's medical query, the system will now automatically present a set of follow-up questions that are relevant to the current topic. These suggestions are designed to anticipate the user's potential next steps or inquiries, based on the context of the conversation. 

The suggested questions will be displayed just above the chat box, making it easy for users to view and select. By simply clicking on one of these suggestions, users can continue their conversation without the need to manually input their next question. This feature not only enhances the user experience by making interactions more fluid and intuitive but also helps in deepening the exploration of topics relevant to the user's needs. 

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### User-Controlled Suggestions

Recognizing the diverse preferences of our users, we have incorporated the flexibility to toggle the follow-up question suggestions feature on or off. This customization option allows users to tailor their interaction with the Medical Chatbot according to their desired level of guidance and exploration within the conversation. Whether users prefer a more self-directed inquiry or guided discovery, this feature enhances the platform's adaptability to individual user needs.
Furthermore, the generation of follow-up questions has been intelligently engineered to specifically address medical-based queries and responses, ensuring the delivery of high-quality suggestions only whenever pertinent.

## Response Style Customization

In our ongoing efforts to improve the user interface and overall experience of the Medical Chatbot, we are excited to announce an enhancement to how users can customize their conversation settings, specifically regarding response styles.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Enhanced Accessibility of Conversation Settings

To provide a more intuitive and accessible way for users to customize their interaction with the Medical Chatbot, we have 
repositioned the conversation settings. Previously located next to the "New Conversation" button within a settings pop-up, these settings could be overlooked by users. We have addressed this by moving the conversation settings to a more prominent position:
1. **Contextual Menu Placement**: The contextual menu, which includes the conversation settings, has been relocated below the response box. This change ensures visibility immediately after a response is generated, especially important when dealing with longer responses that could previously obscure the menu.
2. **Dedicated Settings Icon**: A settings icon has been introduced to the contextual menu for conversation settings, making it easier for users to find and adjust their response style preferences. The response style options have been removed from the Chat settings pop-up and are now accessible via a separate pop-up when the user clicks on the conversation settings icon in the contextual menu. This approach allows for a more streamlined and focused user experience.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Dynamic Response Style Selection

Upon initiating a new conversation, the Default response style is applied. However, users now have the flexibility to change the response style after the first response is generated by the chatbot. By clicking on the conversation settings button, users can select a different style, prompting the chatbot to regenerate the response in the new style. This selected style will persist for all subsequent interactions within the current conversation until the conversation concludes or the user opts to change the style again.

![Response Style Customization](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/johnsnowlabs/assets/85957146/26996a41-a9f6-455f-8ea2-b238f850b090)

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

## Introducing Advanced Resource Management

We are excited to announce an enhancement in how users interact with and manage the resources available within the Medical Chatbot. This update introduces a more intuitive way for users to visualize and control the tools and knowledge bases (KBs) that assist in generating responses to their queries.

</div><div class="h3-box" markdown="1">

### Streamlined Access to Tools and Knowledge Bases

To improve accessibility and user experience, we have made the following changes:
1. **Enhanced Tools Accessibility**: The Chat settings popup, previously located next to the "New Chat" button, has been replaced. We've introduced a "Tools" link situated within the chat box. This popup provides direct access to the various resources available to the chatbot.
2. **Dynamic Resource Display and Management**: Upon accessing the "Tools" section, users will now be presented with a list of available tools, including but not limited to Wikipedia and MedResearch, with future additions such as NLPTools and Text2SQL anticipated. This feature allows users to easily toggle these resources on or off, directly influencing the tools that the Language Learning Model (LLM) leverages to respond to queries.
3. **Customizable Knowledge Base Interaction**: When the MedResearch tool is enabled, users will be shown a list of accessible KBs, similar to the existing functionality. Importantly, users now have the capability to individually activate or deactivate these KBs. This flexibility ensures that the queries are matched against the most relevant and preferred knowledge bases, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the chatbot's responses. 
When all tools are turned off, John will respond from its memory. See next section for details.
