## Ask Specific Questions

To ensure the highest level of accuracy and relevance in the responses provided by our medical chatbot, we encourage users to formulate their queries with specificity and clarity. General or broadly framed questions often carry inherent ambiguities that may lead to misinterpretations by the chatbot's natural language processing algorithms. Such ambiguities can result in responses that may not fully or accurately address the user's intended inquiry. Precise questions allow the chatbot to utilize its tools more effectively, tailoring its analysis and recommendations to the specific context of each query. By focusing on detailed inquiries, users can help minimize misunderstandings and receive the most accurate, relevant, and helpful information tailored to their personal health questions or concerns.

## Switch Between Tools 

For enhancing the flexibility and specificity of interactions, users can directly command `John` to utilize one of the multiple available tools for generating responses. By incorporating specific directives such as "Ask Wikipedia" or "Ask MedResearch" at the end of a query, you can explicitly dictate the tool that `John` should employ to process the request. This functionality is designed to streamline the information retrieval process, ensuring that responses are generated using the most appropriate and relevant tool based on the nature of the inquiry. It effectively narrows down the search scope, allowing for a more focused and accurate response by selectively engaging the tool that is best suited to the context and content of the question.
