**Customize Search Results View**


The application provides a flexible search results table that can be customized to match each userâ€™s needs. Columns can be selected or hidden, allowing users to focus on the information most relevant to their workflow. This configurable view reduces clutter, streamlines results, and highlights key data points for faster review and decision-making.
