## API Service Docs
## API Usage

The API service allows seamless integration with your applications, enabling you to leverage our platformâ€™s capabilities.

After deploying the Terminology Server in your environment, you can access the API right away. 
For a concrete example of how to use the API, see this [code sample](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/products/term_server/terminology_api.ipynb).
