## API Service Access

John Snow Labs' **Terminology Server** provides a **comprehensive API**, enabling full access to all functionality available through the user interface. This allows for **seamless integration** with your applications and the implementation of custom workflows, empowering you to fully leverage the platform's capabilities within your own systems.

Once the installation of the **Terminology Server** is over, start the application and **access the API** by switching to the **API Service** tab in the left navigation panel; click on the **API Service Access** section.
