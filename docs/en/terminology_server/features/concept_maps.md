## Concept Maps

In the context of John Snow Labs Terminology Server, Concept Maps represent the logical relationships between codes across different medical coding system vocabularies. These mappings are curated and maintained by John Snow Labs and are integral to the functionality of the Terminology Server.

The following table shows the list of all Vocabuaries, Datasets and Versions used by Terminology Server:
