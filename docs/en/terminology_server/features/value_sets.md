## Custom Value Sets

A custom Value Set in the context of medical terminology is a user-defined collection of medical codes and terms selected from one or more standard coding systems (such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC, RxNorm, etc.), created to meet a specific need, use case, or organizational requirement.

**Key Characteristics of Custom Value Sets**:
* Tailored: Designed to include only the codes relevant to a specific clinical, research, or operational goal
* Flexible: May draw from multiple coding systems and be modified over time.
* Not standardized: Unlike predefined or published Value Sets from regulatory bodies, custom Value Sets are not universally agreed upon and are typically used internally or within a specific application or workflow.

**Common Use Cases:**
* A hospital may define a custom Value Set for "medications used in cardiology".
* A research team may create one for "cancer-related diagnoses" using a mix of SNOMED and ICD-10 codes.
* A public health agency may define a custom Value Set for "reportable diseases" specific to its jurisdiction.

In Terminology Server Tools, custom Value Sets can often be:
* Created manually or programmatically
* Versioned and updated
* Used in conjunction with concept search, validation, and filtering features

**John Snow Labs' Terminology Server** supports the use of custom Value Sets, offering the following capabilities:
* Upload custom Value Sets created externally in Excel or CSV format using the built-in Upload feature.
* View, create new versions, delete
* Filter search results based on the codes included in a selected Value Set.

## Uploading a Custom Value Set

Uploading a custom Value Set is simple and intuitive:
* In the **left navigation panel**, click on the **Value Sets** node.
* Use the "**Browse Files**" button or drag your Excel/CSV file into the upload area, then click **Upload** to import your custom Value Set.

* Once uploaded, the new Value Set will appear in the **left panel** under the Value Sets section..

* To **create a new Value Set** or **add a new version** to an existing one, click the **"Upload"** link on the right-hand side.

* Each **new version** will appear as a child node under the corresponding Value Set.

* To **view**, **download**, or **delete** a version, use the icons next to it.

ðŸ”´ Note: Deleting the last remaining version will remove the entire Value Set from the system.

## Filtering Search Results with Value Sets

When performing a **medical term search in Terminology Server**, you can apply **custom Value Sets** to filter and refine your results.

Example: 
1. Search for the term "cancer". Notice the top record in the results, having **LOINC** Concept Code **LA10524-9** 
![Terminology Service by John Snow Labs](/assets/images/term_server/SearchResultsForVSFilter.png)
2. Assume for example **Histology Carcinoma** as a previously uploaded Value Set (figure below). In this example, the Value Set contains 2 records with the Concept Code **LA10524-9** mapped to two custom codes: **M85306** and **M85307** :

3. In the left navigation panel, check the box next to the Value Set you want to use as a filter, in our case the **Version 1** under **Histology Carcinoma**. The name of the Value Set and the selected version are now displayed as applied filter.  
4. After applying the filter, the results table will display a new column labeled **"ValueSet"**. ![Terminology Service by John Snow Labs](/assets/images/term_server/FilteredResultsByVS.png)

Thw **ValueSet** column in the search results table above, indicates which search results are included in the selected Value Set by cross-referencing the **concept codes** from your search with those defined in the Value Set vocabulary.
The information in this column is derived from the specific version of the selected Value Set file.
