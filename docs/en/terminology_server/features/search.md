## Concept Search

üöÄ The standout feature of John Snow Lab‚Äôs Terminology Server is its **concept search** capability: it excels by leveraging associated synonyms, accounting for **misspellings**, and employing both **string matching** and **semantic search** when seeking **similarity searches** results and when the system returns the best matching concept from the terminology embedding database.

The user can opt for either of the search types, or utilize both in tandem ‚Äî this is the default setting.
Terminology Server offers stable and deterministic results. The same term(concept) will always return the same code, thanks to its reliance on official terminology datasets and carefully curated in-house augmentations.

Terminology Server performs term-level mapping: searching a term will return the best matching concept from the terminology database.
* It does not infer additional context or concepts beyond the input
* It does not perform document-level analysis.
* Providing an entire document as search input might lead to the embeddings becoming diluted, and potential nonsensical results.

 It is straight forward to choose between the type of search:
 1. Click on the Filters icon in the top right corner of the application
 2. Select the search type from the options from the Filters panel
 3. Exit the Filters panel by clicking anywhere outside

It is posible to improve your search outcomes by utilizing a variety of additional filters:
* Domain: Specifies the general topic area of a concept (e.g., Condition/Device, Condition/Meas, Drug, Gender). The available options for this filter are pre-populated in the dropdown list.

* OMOP Standards Concepts Only: Limits the search results to concepts that are flagged as ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù in the OMOP CDM.
* Include Only Valid Concepts: Filters out concepts that have been invalidated due to deletion or being superseded.
* Filter by Confidence Score: Allows refining results based on their confidence score.
