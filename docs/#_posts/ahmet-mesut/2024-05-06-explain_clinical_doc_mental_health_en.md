## Description

This pipeline is designed to

- extract all mental health-related entities from text,

- assign assertion status to the extracted entities,

- establish relations between the extracted entities.

5 NER models, one assertion model and one relation extraction model were used in order to achieve those tasks.

Clinical Entity Labels:

`Mental_Health`, `Opioid_Drug`, `Substance_Use`, `Substance_Quantity`, `Injury_or_Poisoning`, `Symptom`, `Drug`, `Drug_Dosage`, `Drug_Duration`, `Drug_Route`, `Drug_Form`, `Frequency`, `Drug_Strength`, `Procedure`, `Treatment`, `Test`, `Test_Result`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`, `Smoking`, `Alcohol`, `Social_Exclusion`, `Family_Member`, `Childhood_Event`, `Disability`, `Eating_Disorder`, `Violence_Or_Abuse`

Assertion Status Labels:

`Present`, `Absent`, `Possible`, `Planned`, `Past`, `Family`, `Hypotetical`, `SomeoneElse`

Relation Extraction Labels:

`Drug- Drug_Dosage`, `Drug-Frequency`, `Drug-Duration`, `Drug-Drug_Strength`, `Drug-Drug`, `Test-Test_Result`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Symptom`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Drug`, `Symptom-Drug`, `Treatment_Drug`, `Symptom-Treatment`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Treatment`, `Treatment-Drug`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Procedure`, `Procedure-Drug`, `Mental_Health-Opioid_Drug`,  `Mental_Health-Substance_Use`,  `Mental_Health-Injury_or_Poisoning`, `Mental_Health-Symptom`, `Mental_Health-Drug`, `Mental_Health-Procedure`, `Mental_Health-Treatment`, `Mental_Health-Test`, `Mental_Health-Gender`, `Mental_Health-Age`, `Mental_Health-Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`, `Mental_Health-Smoking`, `Mental_Health-Alcohol`, `Mental_Health-Social_Exclusion`, `Mental_Health-Childhood_Event`, `Mental_Health-Disability`, `Mental_Health-Eating_Disorder`, `Mental_Health- Violence_Or_Abuse`,  `Opioid_Drug-Symptom`, `Opioid_Drug-Procedure`, `Opioid_Drug-Treatment`, `Opioid_Drug-Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`, `Opioid_Drug-Smoking`, `Opioid_Drug-Alcohol`, `Opioid_Drug-Childhood_Event`, `Opioid_Drug-Disability`, `Opioid_Drug-Eating_Disorder`, `Opioid_Drug-Violence_Or_Abuse`, `Opioid_Drug-Social_Exclusion`, `Substance_Use-Symptom`, `Substance_Use-Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`, `Substance_Use-Smoking`, `Substance_Use-Alcohol`, `Substance_Use-Childhood_Event`, `Substance_Use-Disability`, `Substance_Use-Eating_Disorder`, `Substance_Use-Violence_Or_Abuse`, `Substance_Use-Social_Exclusion`, `Substance_Use-Substance_Quantity`, `Injury_or_Poisoning-Symptom`, `Injury_or_Poisoning-Procedure`, `Injury_or_Poisoning-Test`, `Injury_or_Poisoning-Childhood_Event`, `Injury_or_Poisoning-Disability`, `Symptom-Procedure`, `Symptom-Test`, `Symptom-Eating_Disorder`, `Procedure-Disability`, `Opioid_Drug-Gender`, `Substance_Use-Gender`, `Opioid_Drug-Age`, `Substance_Use-Age`, `Violence_Or_Abuse-Gender`, `Violence_Or_Abuse-Age`, `Childhood_Event-Gender`, `Childhood_Event-Age`, `Alcohol-Gender`, `Alcohol-Age`, `Smoking-Gender`, `Smoking-Age`, `Social_Exclusion-Gender`, `Eating_Disorder-Disease_Syndrome_Disorder`, `Eating_Disorder-Treatment`, `Eating_Disorder-Alcohol`, `Eating_Disorder-Smoking`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Test`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Smoking`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Alcohol`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Social_Exclusion`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Childhood_Event`, `Disease_Syndrome_Disorder-Violence_Or_Abuse`, `Social_Exclusion-Alcohol`, `Social_Exclusion-Smoking`, `Social_Exclusion-Childhood_Event`, `Social_Exclusion-Disability`, `Social_Exclusion-Violence_Or_Abuse`, `Family_Member-Mental_Health`, `Childhood_Event-Disability`, `Childhood_Event-Eating_Disorder`, `Childhood_Event-Violence_Or_Abuse`
