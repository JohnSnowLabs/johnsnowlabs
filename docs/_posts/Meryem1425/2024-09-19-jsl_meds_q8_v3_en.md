## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
  
```python
from sparknlp_jsl.llm import LLMLoader

llm_loader_pretrained = LLMLoader(spark).pretrained("jsl_meds_q8_v3", "en", "clinical/models")

prompt = """
A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus.
Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
A: Ampicillin
B: Ceftriaxone
C: Ciprofloxacin
D: Doxycycline
E: Nitrofurantoin
"""

response = llm_loader_pretrained.generate(prompt)

```
```scala

val llmLoader = new LLMLoader().setSparkSession(spark).pretrained("jsl_meds_q8_v3", "en", "clinical/models")

## Results

```bash
"""
The best treatment for this patient is E: Nitrofurantoin. This medication is considered safe during pregnancy and is effective for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is important to avoid antibiotics that are contraindicated during pregnancy, such as tetracyclines (D: Doxycycline) and fluoroquinolones (C: Ciprofloxacin). Ampicillin (A) and Ceftriaxone (B) are also generally safe during pregnancy, but Nitrofurantoin is often preferred due to its specific efficacy for UTIs.
