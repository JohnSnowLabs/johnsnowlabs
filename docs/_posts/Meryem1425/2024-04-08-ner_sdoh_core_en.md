## Description

SDOH NER model is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals’ health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental element. The model has been trained using advanced machine learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. The model can accurately recognize and classify a wide range of SDOH entities, including but not limited to factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, housing conditions, access to healthcare services, employment status, cultural and ethnic background, neighborhood characteristics, and environmental factors. The model’s accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. Here are the labels of the SDOH NER model with their description:

- `Access_To_Care` : Patient’s ability or barriers to access the care needed. "long distances, access to health care, rehab program, etc."
- `Chidhood_Event` : Childhood events mentioned by the patient. “childhood trauma, childhood abuse, etc.”
- `Community_Safety` : safety of the neighborhood or places of study or work. “dangerous neighborhood, safe area, etc.”
- `Disability` : Mentions related to disability
- `Eating_Disorder` : This entity is used to extract eating disorders. “anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc.”
- `Education` : Patient’s educational background
- `Environmental_Condition` : Conditions of the environment where people live. “pollution, air quality, noisy environment, etc.”
- `Exercise` : Mentions of the exercise habits of a patient. “exercise, physical activity, play football, go to the gym, etc.”

- `Mental_Health` : Include all the mental, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diagnosis, disorders, conditions or syndromes mentioned. “depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, etc.”
- `Other_SDoH_Keywords` : This label is used to annotated terms or sentences that provide information about social determinants of health that are not already extracted under any other entity label. “minimal activities of daily living, ack of government programs, etc.”
- `Population_Group` : The population group that a person belongs to, that does not fall under any other entities. “refugee, prison patient, etc.”
- `Quality_Of_Life` : Quality of life refers to how an individual feels about their current station in life. “ lower quality of life, profoundly impact his quality of life, etc.”
