## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
```python
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

resolver_pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("icd10cm_resolver_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

text = """A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years and anisakiasis. Also, it was reported that fetal and neonatal hemorrhage"""

result = resolver_pipeline.fullAnnotate(text)
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val resolver_pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("icd10cm_resolver_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

val result = resolver_pipeline.fullAnnotate("""A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years and anisakiasis. Also, it was reported that fetal and neonatal hemorrhage""")
```
