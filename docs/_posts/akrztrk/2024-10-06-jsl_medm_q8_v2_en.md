## Description

This LLM model is trained to extract and link entities in a document. Users needs to define an input schema as explained in the example section. Drug is defined as a list which tells the model that there could be multiple drugs in the document and it has to extract all of them. Each drug has properties like name and reaction. Since “name” is only one, it is a string, but there could be multiple reactions, hence it is a list. Similarly, users can define any schema for any type of entity.

## Results

```bash

The correct answer is E: Nitrofurantoin.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI), which is common during pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is a first-line antibiotic for uncomplicated UTI during pregnancy. It is safe and effective in treating UTI during pregnancy and has been used for many years without any adverse effects on the fetus.
