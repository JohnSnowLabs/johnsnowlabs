## Description

The Alcohol Usage classifier utilizes [MPNET embeddings](https://sparknlp.org/2023/08/29/mpnet_embedding_all_mpnet_base_v2_by_sentence_transformers_en.html) within a robust classifier architecture.
This model, trained on various datasets, provides accurate label assignments and confidence scores for its predictions. Utilizing MPNET embedding technology, it excels in comprehensive text analysis and offers valuable insights into alcohol usage within the provided texts. The primary goal of the model is to categorize texts into two main label categories: 'Current_Drinker' and 'Others.'

- `Current_Drinker`: This category encompasses statements indicating the person's current alcohol usage or situations where information regarding this matter is provided or available.

- `Others`: This category encompasses statements indicating the absence of current alcohol usage or situations where the information on this matter is unknown or not provided.

## Predicted Entities

`Current_Drinker`, `Others`
