## Description

Assign assertion status to clinical entities extracted by NER based on their context in the text. Also this model is trained on a list of clinical and biomedical datasets curated in-house

## Predicted Entities

`Absent`, `Past`, `Present`, `Someone_Else`, `Hypothetical`, `Possible`
