## Description

The Mental Health classifier employs [MedicalBertForSequenceClassification embeddings](https://sparknlp.org/2022/07/18/biobert_pubmed_base_cased_v1.2_en_3_0.html) within a robust classifier architecture. Trained on a diverse dataset, this model provides accurate label assignments and confidence scores for its predictions. The primary goal of this model is to categorize text into two key labels: `Mental_Disorder` and `No_Or_Not_Mentioned`.

- `Mental_Disorder`: It encompasses a wide range of mental health conditions that affect a person's mood, thinking, behavior, and overall psychological well-being.

- `No_Or_Not_Mentioned`: The patient doesnâ€™t have mental health problems or it is not mentioned in the clinical notes.

## Predicted Entities

`Mental_Disorder`, `No_Or_Not_Mentioned`
