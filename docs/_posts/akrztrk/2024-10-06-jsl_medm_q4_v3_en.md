## Description

This LLM model is trained to extract and link entities in a document. Users needs to define an input schema as explained in the example section. Drug is defined as a list which tells the model that there could be multiple drugs in the document and it has to extract all of them. Each drug has properties like name and reaction. Since “name” is only one, it is a string, but there could be multiple reactions, hence it is a list. Similarly, users can define any schema for any type of entity.

## Results

```bash

The best treatment for a pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presenting with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) is:

E: Nitrofurantoin

Here's the rationale:

- The patient's symptoms of burning upon urination, worsening over a day, and absence of costovertebral angle tenderness suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient is pregnant, which increases the risk of UTIs and their complications, such as pyelonephritis
