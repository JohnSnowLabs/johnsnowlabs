## Results

```bash

The best treatment for this patient is E: Nitrofurantoin. This medication is considered safe during pregnancy and is effective for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is important to avoid antibiotics that are contraindicated during pregnancy, such as tetracyclines (D: Doxycycline) and fluoroquinolones (C: Ciprofloxacin). Ampicillin (A) and Ceftriaxone (B) are also generally safe during pregnancy, but Nitrofurantoin is often preferred due to its specific efficacy for UTIs.
