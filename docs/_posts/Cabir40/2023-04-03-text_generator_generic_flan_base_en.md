## Description

This model is a modified version of Flan-T5 (LLM) based text generation model, which is basically the same as official [Flan-T5-base model] [https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base] released by Google.  Given a few tokens as an intro, it can generate human-like, conceptually meaningful texts  up to 512 tokens given an input text (max 1024 tokens).

## How to use



<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python

document_assembler = DocumentAssembler()\
    .setInputCol("prompt")\
    .setOutputCol("document_prompt")

med_text_generator  = MedicalTextGenerator.pretrained("text_generator_generic_flan_base", "en", "clinical/models")\
    .setInputCols("document_prompt")\
    .setOutputCol("answer")\
    .setMaxNewTokens(256)\
    .setDoSample(True)\
    .setTopK(3)\
    .setRandomSeed(42)

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, med_text_generator])

data = spark.createDataFrame([["the patient is admitted to the clinic with a severe back pain and "]]).toDF("prompt")

pipeline.fit(data).transform(data)

```
```scala

val document_assembler = new DocumentAssembler()
    .setInputCol("prompt")
    .setOutputCol("document_prompt")

val med_text_generator  = MedicalTextGenerator.pretrained("text_generator_generic_flan_base", "en", "clinical/models")
    .setInputCols("document_prompt")
    .setOutputCol("answer")
    .setMaxNewTokens(256)
    .setDoSample(true)
    .setTopK(3)
    .setRandomSeed(42)

val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(document_assembler, med_text_generator))

val data = Seq(Array("the patient is admitted to the clinic with a severe back pain and ")).toDS.toDF("prompt")

val result = pipeline.fit(data).transform(data)

```
</div>

## Results

```bash

['the patient is admitted to the clinic with a severe back pain and a severe left - sided leg pain. The patient was diagnosed with a lumbar disc herniation and underwent a discectomy. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. The patient was followed up for a period of 6 months and was found to be asymptomatic. A rare case of a giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Giant cell tumors ( GCTs ) are benign, locally aggressive tumors that are most commonly found in the long bones of the extremities. They are rarely found in the spine. We report a case of a GCT of the sacrum in a young female patient. The patient presented with a history of progressive lower back pain and a palpable mass in the left buttock. The patient underwent a left hemilaminectomy and biopsy. The histopathological examination revealed a GCT. The patient was treated with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. The patient was followed up for 2 years and no recurrence was observed. A rare case of a giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Giant cell tumors ( GCTs ) are benign, locally aggressive tumors that are most commonly found in the long bones of the extremities. They are rarely found in the spine. We report a case of a GCT']
