## Description

This NER model extracts valuable information from clinical documents, concentrating on various medical conditions and crucial sections of patient records. With defined labels encompassing diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's, it offers deeper insights into diagnosis and treatment patterns.

Definitions of Predicted Entities

`Heart disease`: References to any diagnosed cardiovascular pathology that compromises the heart's structure or function.

`Cerebrovascular disease`: References to diagnosed pathologies that affect cerebral circulation or blood vessels within the brain.

`Oncological Disease`: Refers to confirmed diagnoses associated with malignant growths or tumors, which arise from uncontrolled and abnormal cell division.

`Respiratory disease`: References to diagnosed pathologies that compromise the structure or function of the respiratory tract.

`Obesity`: Diagnosis of the condition characterized by excessive body fat that adversely affects a patient's health. (overweight and BMI will not be extracted under this label).

`Diabetes`: Diagnosis of any form of diabetes mellitus, chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.

`Infectious disease`: Diagnosed conditions that pertain to diseases caused by infectious pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.

`Kidney disease`: Diagnoses related to pathologies that compromise the renal function or structure.

`Mental disorder`: Diagnoses encompassing a wide array of psychiatric or psychological disorders that affect cognitive, emotional, or behavioral function.

`Alzheimer Disease`: Specific diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline.

`Patient info header`: The section of a document that contains essential details about the patient such as the patient's full name, date of birth, gender, contact information, insurance details and any other pertinent demographic data necessary for accurate patient identification.

`Medical History Header`: Identifies the section of a medical document that contains a summary of the patient's medical conditions. It encompasses details about the patient's overall health, including chronic illnesses, past injuries, and significant events related to their health.

`Clinical History Header`: Identifies section headers that refer to the patient's clinical history, including previous and ongoing healthcare encounters and interventions.

`History of Present Illness Header`: Identifies section headers that refer to the narrative description of the development of the patient's present illness from the first sign or symptom until the present.

`Medications Header`: Identifies section headers that pertain to the patient's current and past medications.

`Allergies Header`: Identifies section headers that detail the patient's known allergies, including drug allergies and other types of hypersensitivity reactions.

`Laboratory Results Header`: Identifies section headers that include results of lab tests, such as blood tests, urine tests, or other laboratory examinations.

`Imaging Studies Header`: Identifies section headers that summarize the findings of imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans.

`Diagnosis Header`: Identifies section headers that list the patient's current and past diagnoses.

`Treatment Plan Header`: Identifies section headers that outline the patient's management plan, including medications, therapies, surgeries, or other interventions.

## Predicted Entities

`Heart disease`, `Cerebrovascular disease`, `Respiratory disease`, `Alzheimer Disease`, `Obesity`, `Oncological Disease`, `Diabetes`, `Infectious disease`, `Kidney disease`, `Mental disorder`, `Patient info header`, `Medical History Header`, `Clinical History Header`, `History of Present Illness Header`, `Medications Header`, `Allergies Header`, `Laboratory Results Header`, `Imaging Studies Header`, `Diagnosis Header`, `Treatment Plan Header`

Clinical History:
Patient presented with shortness of breath and chest pain.
Chief Complaint:
Patient complained of chest pain and difficulty breathing.
History of Present Illness:
Patient has been experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath for the past week. Symptoms were relieved by medication at first but became worse over time.
Past Medical History:
