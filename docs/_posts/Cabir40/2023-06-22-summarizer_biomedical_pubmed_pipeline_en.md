For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).\n Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival.

Results



The results of this review suggest that aggressive ovarian cancer surgery is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence and a reduction in the number of radical versus conservative surgical resections. However, the results of this review are based on only one small trial. Further research is needed to determine the role of aggressive ovarian cancer surgery in women with stage IIIC ovarian cancer.
