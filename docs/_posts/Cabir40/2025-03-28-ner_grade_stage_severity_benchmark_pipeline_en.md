Mrs. Saujule T. Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .
This course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .
An abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .
Two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6. She was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress . Head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .
Abdomen :
showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
Pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .
The patient was occult blood negative .
Extremities : showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis . However , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .
