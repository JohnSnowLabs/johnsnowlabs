```python

Based on the following text, what age group is most susceptible to breast cancer?

## Text:
The exact cause of breast cancer is unknown. However, several risk factors can increase your likelihood of developing breast cancer, such as:
- A personal or family history of breast cancer
- A genetic mutation, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2
- Exposure to radiation
- Age (most commonly occurring in women over 50)
- Early onset of menstruation or late menopause
- Obesity
- Hormonal factors, such as taking hormone replacement therapy
"""

response = llm_loader_pretrained.generate(ptompt)
