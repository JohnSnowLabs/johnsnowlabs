## Description

This pretrained pipeline includes the Medical Bert for Sequence Classification model to identify texts that mention a HCP consult. The pipeline is built on the top of  [bert_sequence_classifier_vop_hcp_consult](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/06/13/bert_sequence_classifier_vop_hcp_consult_en.html) model.

## How to use

<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}
  
```python
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("bert_sequence_classifier_vop_hcp_consult_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

pipeline.annotate("My son has been to two doctors who gave him antibiotic drops but they also say the problem might related to allergies.")
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("bert_sequence_classifier_vop_hcp_consult_pipeline", "en", "clinical/models")

val result = pipeline.annotate(My son has been to two doctors who gave him antibiotic drops but they also say the problem might related to allergies.)
```
</div>
