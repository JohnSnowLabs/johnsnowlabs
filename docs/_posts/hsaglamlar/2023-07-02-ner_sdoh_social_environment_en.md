## Description

SDOH NER model is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) social environment entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals' health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental elements. The model has been trained using advanced machine-learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. The model's accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. Here are the labels of the SDOH NER model with their description:

- `Chidhood_Event`: Childhood events mentioned by the patient. "childhood trauma, childhood abuse, etc."
- `Legal_Issues`: Issues that have legal implications. "legal issues, legal problems, detention, in prison, etc."
- `Social_Exclusion`: Absence or lack of rights or accessibility to services or goods that are expected of the majority of the population. "social exclusion, social isolation, gender discrimination, etc."
- `Social_Support`: he presence of friends, family or other people to turn to for comfort or help.  "social support, live with family, etc."
- `Violence_Or_Abuse`: Episodes of abuse or violence experienced and reported by the patient. "domestic violence, sexual abuse, etc."

## Predicted Entities

`Chidhood_Event`, `Legal_Issues`, `Social_Exclusion`, `Social_Support`, `Violence_Or_Abuse`
