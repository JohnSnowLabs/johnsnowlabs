## Description

This SDOH NER model is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) demographic entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals' health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental elements. The model has been trained using advanced machine-learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. The model's accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. Here are the labels of the SDOH NER model with their description:

- `Age`: All mention of ages including "Newborn, Infant, Child, Teenager, Teenage, Adult, etc."
- `Family_Member`: Nouns that refer to a family member. "mother, father, brother, sister, etc."
- `Gender`: Gender-specific nouns and pronouns
- `Geographic_Entity`: Geographical location refers to a specific physical point on Earth. 
- `Language`: A system of conventional spoken, manual (signed), or written symbols by means of which human beings express themselves. "English, Spanish-speaking, etc. "
- `Race_Ethnicity`: The race and ethnicity categories include racial, ethnic, and national origins.
- `Spiritual_Beliefs`: Spirituality is concerned with beliefs beyond self, usually related to the existence of a superior being. "spiritual beliefs, religious beliefs, etc."

## Predicted Entities

`Age`, `Family_Member`, `Gender`, `Geographic_Entity`, `Language`, `Race_Ethnicity`, `Spiritual_Beliefs`
