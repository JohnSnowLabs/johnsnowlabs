## Description

SDOH NER model is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) health behavior and problem related entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals' health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental elements. 
The model has been trained using advanced machine-learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. The model's accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. Here are the labels of the SDOH NER model with their description:

- `Communicable_Disease`: Include all the communicable diseases. "HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, etc."
- `Diet`: Information regarding the patient’s dietary habits. "vegetarian, vegan, healthy foods, low-calorie diet, etc."
- `Disability`: Mentions related to disability
- `Eating_Disorder`: This entity is used to extract eating disorders. "anorexia, bulimia, pica, etc."
- `Exercise`: Mentions of the exercise habits of a patient. "exercise, physical activity, play football, go to the gym, etc."
- `Hyperlipidemia`: Terms that indicate hyperlipidemia and relevant subtypes. "hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated cholesterol, etc."
- `Hypertension`: Terms related to hypertension. "hypertension, high blood pressure, etc."
- `Mental_Health`: Include all the mental, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental diagnoses, disorders, conditions, or syndromes mentioned. "depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, etc."
- `Obesity`: Terms related to the patient being obese. "obesity, overweight, etc."
- `Other_Disease`: Include all the diseases mentioned. "psoriasis, thromboembolism, etc." 
- `Quality_Of_Life`: Quality of life refers to how an individual feels about their current station in life. " lower quality of life, profoundly impact his quality of life, etc."
- `Sexual_Activity`: Mentions of patient’s sexual behaviors. "monogamous, sexual activity, inconsistent condom use, etc."

## Predicted Entities

`Communicable_Disease`, `Diet`, `Disability`, `Eating_Disorder`, `Exercise`, `Hyperlipidemia`, `Hypertension`, `Mental_Health`, `Obesity`, `Other_Disease`, `Quality_Of_Life`, `Sexual_Activity`
