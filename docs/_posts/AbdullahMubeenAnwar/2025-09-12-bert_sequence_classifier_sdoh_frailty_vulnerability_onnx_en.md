## Description

The Fraitly classifier employs [MedicalBertForSequenceClassification embeddings](https://sparknlp.org/2022/07/18/biobert_pubmed_base_cased_v1.2_en_3_0.html) within a robust classifier architecture. Trained on a diverse dataset, this model provides accurate label assignments and confidence scores for its predictions. The primary goal of this model is to categorize text into two key labels: `Frailty_Vulnerability` and `No_Or_Unknown`.

- `Frailty_Vulnerability`: This category includes statements that highlight concerns, signs or symptoms associated with frailty and/or vulnerability conditions.

- `No_Or_Unknown`: This category encompasses statements that either do not present any identifiable concerns related to frailty/vulnerability or where the presence or extent of frailty/ vulnerability is indeterminate.

## Predicted Entities

`Frailty_Vulnerability`, `No_Or_Unknown`
