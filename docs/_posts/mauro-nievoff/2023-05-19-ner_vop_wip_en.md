## Description

This model extracts healthcare-related terms from the documents transferred from the patient‚Äôs own sentences.

Note: ‚Äòwip‚Äô suffix indicates that the model development is work-in-progress and will be finalised and the model performance will improved in the upcoming releases.

## Predicted Entities

`TestResult`, `SubstanceQuantity`, `InjuryOrPoisoning`, `Treatment`, `Modifier`, `HealthStatus`, `MedicalDevice`, `Procedure`, `Symptom`, `Frequency`, `RelationshipStatus`, `Duration`, `Allergen`, `VitalTest`, `Disease`, `Dosage`, `AdmissionDischarge`, `Test`, `Laterality`, `Route`, `DateTime`, `Drug`, `ClinicalDept`, `Vaccine`, `Form`, `Substance`, `PsychologicalCondition`, `Age`, `BodyPart`, `Employment`, `Gender`
