## Description

This model extracts healthcare-related terms from the documents transferred from the patient‚Äôs own sentences.

Note: ‚Äòwip‚Äô suffix indicates that the model development is work-in-progress and will be finalised and the model performance will improved in the upcoming releases.

## Predicted Entities

`Allergen`, `SubstanceQuantity`, `RaceEthnicity`, `Measurements`, `InjuryOrPoisoning`, `Treatment`, `TestResult`, `Modifier`, `Route`, `MedicalDevice`, `Vaccine`, `RelationshipStatus`, `Frequency`, `HealthStatus`, `Procedure`, `Duration`, `DateTime`, `Disease`, `Test`, `Substance`, `Symptom`, `Laterality`, `Dosage`, `ClinicalDept`, `PsychologicalCondition`, `VitalTest`, `Age`, `Drug`, `BodyPart`, `AdmissionDischarge`, `Form`, `Employment`, `Gender`

Hello,I"m 20 year old girl. I"m diagnosed with hyperthyroid 1 month ago. I was feeling weak, light headed,poor digestion, panic attacks, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate, rapidly weight loss,  from 4 months. Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital. I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem. Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal . Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I"m taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily. I"m taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now. I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I"m facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate. I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay? Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time.
