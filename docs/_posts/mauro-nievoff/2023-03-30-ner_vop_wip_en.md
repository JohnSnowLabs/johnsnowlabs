## Description

This model extracts healthcare-related terms from the documents transferred from the patient‚Äôs own sentences.

Note: ‚Äòwip‚Äô suffix indicates that the model development is work-in-progress and will be finalised and the model performance will improved in the upcoming releases.

## Predicted Entities

`SubstanceQuantity`, `Measurements`, `Treatment`, `Modifier`, `RaceEthnicity`, `Allergen`, `TestResult`, `InjuryOrPoisoning`, `Frequency`, `MedicalDevice`, `Procedure`, `Duration`, `DateTime`, `HealthStatus`, `Route`, `Vaccine`, `Disease`, `Symptom`, `RelationshipStatus`, `Dosage`, `Substance`, `VitalTest`, `AdmissionDischarge`, `Test`, `Laterality`, `ClinicalDept`, `PsychologicalCondition`, `Age`, `BodyPart`, `Drug`, `Employment`, `Form`
