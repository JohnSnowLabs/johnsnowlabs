## Description

Multi-label document classification is a technique that identifies semantic categories for entire documents. In the biomedical field, these semantic categories are valuable for understanding the main topics and conducting literature searches. Unlike multi-class classification, which assigns only one label to each instance, multi-label classification allows for assigning multiple labels, up to N, to a single instance. LitCovid is a manually annotated multi-label document classification dataset specifically designed for COVID-19 topics, consisting of seven labels.

The objective of the multilabel classification model is to determine the relevant COVID-19 topics of an article based on its abstract. You will need to determine whether the article is related to any of the following seven topics, each with its own definition:

- **Mechanism:** explores the underlying causes of COVID-19 infections and transmission, as well as potential mechanisms of action for drugs.
- **Transmission:** focuses on the characteristics and modes of COVID-19 transmission.
- **Diagnosis:** pertains to the assessment of COVID-19 through symptoms, test results, and radiological features.
- **Treatment:** involves strategies for treating COVID-19, including therapeutic procedures and vaccine development.
- **Prevention:** addresses prevention, control, mitigation, and management strategies for COVID-19.
- **Case_Report:** entails descriptions of specific patient cases related to COVID-19.
- **Epidemic_Forecasting:** involves estimating the trend of COVID-19 spread and utilizing related modeling approaches.

This model is inspired from [Large language models in biomedical natural language processing: benchmarks, baselines, and recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16326) and augmented internally for better coverage and performance.

The pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and especially of its complications is still not fully understood. In fact, a very high number of patients with COVID-19 die because of thromboembolic causes. A role of plasminogen, as precursor of fibrinolysis, has been hypothesized. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between plasminogen levels and COVID-19-related outcomes in a population of 55 infected Caucasian patients (mean age: 69.8 +/- 14.3, 41.8% female). Low levels of plasminogen were significantly associated with inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, and IL-6), markers of coagulation (D-dimer, INR, and APTT), and markers of organ dysfunctions (high fasting blood glucose and decrease in the glomerular filtration rate). A multidimensional analysis model, including the correlation of the expression of coagulation with inflammatory parameters, indicated that plasminogen tended to cluster together with IL-6, hence suggesting a common pathway of activation during disease's complication. Moreover, low levels of plasminogen strongly correlated with mortality in COVID-19 patients even after multiple adjustments for presence of confounding. These data suggest that plasminogen may play a pivotal role in controlling the complex mechanisms beyond the COVID-19 complications, and may be useful both as biomarker for prognosis and for therapeutic target against this extremely aggressive infection."""
