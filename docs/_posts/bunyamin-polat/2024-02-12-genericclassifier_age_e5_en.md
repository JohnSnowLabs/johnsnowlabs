## Description

The GenericClassifierModel is a sophisticated text classification tool tailored to identify and categorize text according to different age groups. This model distinguishes among 'Old Adult', 'Adult', and 'Child and Teen' contexts, providing valuable insights into textual data that references age-specific scenarios or concerns. Detailed information about the classes is as follows:

`Old Adult`: This category includes texts that pertain to older adults, often addressing age-specific health issues, lifestyle considerations, or geriatric care. For instance, a text might discuss mobility challenges or medical conditions more prevalent in elderly populations.

`Adult`: Texts under this classification refer to the adult age group, encompassing a wide range of topics from general health care to workplace issues. These texts often deal with health, social, and economic aspects relevant to the adult population. 

`Child and Teen`: This classification captures texts related to children and teenagers, focusing on pediatric health, developmental stages, educational concerns, and youth-related social issues.

`Other/Unknown`: This category includes texts where the patient's age is not specified or is irrelevant to the content. These texts may cover a wide range of topics applicable to all age groups or focus on general health and wellness issues that are not age-specific. For example, a text might discuss the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise routine for overall health, without targeting a specific age group.
