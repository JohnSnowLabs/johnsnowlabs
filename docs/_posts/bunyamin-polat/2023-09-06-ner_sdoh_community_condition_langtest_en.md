## Description

SDOH NER model is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) community condition-related entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals' health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental elements. 
The model has been trained using advanced machine-learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. The model's accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. This model is the version of [ner_sdoh_community_condition](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/07/02/ner_sdoh_community_condition_en.html) model augmented with `langtest` library.

Definitions of Predicted Entities:

Here are the labels of the SDOH NER model with their description:

- `Community_Safety`: safety of the neighborhood or places of study or work. "dangerous neighborhood, safe area, etc."
- `Environmental_Condition`: Conditions of the environment where people live. "pollution, air quality, noisy environment, etc."
- `Food_Insecurity`: Food insecurity is defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. "food insecurity, scarcity of protein, lack of food, etc."
- `Housing`: Conditions of the patientâ€™s living spaces. "homeless, housing, small apartment, etc."
- `Transportation`: mentions of accessibility to transportation means. "car, bus, train, etc."

## Predicted Entities

`Community_Safety`, `Environmental_Condition`, `Food_Insecurity`, `Housing`, `Transportation`
