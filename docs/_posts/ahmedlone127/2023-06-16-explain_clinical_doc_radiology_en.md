## Description

A pipeline for detecting posology entities with the `ner_radiology` NER model, assigning their assertion status with `assertion_dl_radiology` model, and extracting relations between posology-related terminology with `re_test_problem_finding` relation extraction model.

## Predicted Entities

## How to use

<div class="tabs-box" markdown="1">
{% include programmingLanguageSelectScalaPythonNLU.html %}

```python
from sparknlp.pretrained import PretrainedPipeline

pipeline = PretrainedPipeline("explain_clinical_doc_radiology", "en", "clinical/models")

text = """Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder. This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow. This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma."""

result = pipeline.fullAnnotate(text)
```
```scala
import com.johnsnowlabs.nlp.pretrained.PretrainedPipeline

val pipeline = new PretrainedPipeline("explain_clinical_doc_radiology", "en", "clinical/models")

val text = """Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.

val result = pipeline.fullAnnotate(text)
