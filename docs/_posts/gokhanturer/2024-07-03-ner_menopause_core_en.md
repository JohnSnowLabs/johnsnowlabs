## Description

Menopause Core model is designed to detect and label core entities related to menopause and associated conditions within text data. Menopause-related terms and conditions are crucial factors that influence individuals’ health outcomes, especially among women undergoing the menopausal transition. The model has been trained using advanced machine learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. It can accurately recognize and classify a wide range of menopause-related entities. The model’s accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results. Here are the labels of the Menopause Core model with their description:

`Perimenopause` : The transition period before menopause, which can last from a few months to several years. 
`Menopause` : The permanent end of menstrual cycles for at least 12 consecutive months. 
`Gynecological_Symptom` : Symptoms related to the female reproductive system. 
`Gynecological_Disease` : Diseases affecting the female reproductive system. 
`Other_Symptom` : Symptoms not specifically categorized under other defined labels. 
`Irregular_Menstruation` : Variations in the menstrual cycle.
`G_P` : Information about the patient's gynecological history, including gravida (number of pregnancies) and para (number of births). 
`Hypertension` : Persistently elevated blood pressure. 
`Osteoporosis` : A condition characterized by weak and brittle bones. 
`Oncological` : Conditions related to cancer. 
`Fracture` : Breaks in bones due to mechanical forces. 
`Hormone_Replacement_Therapy` (HRT) : Hormone therapy to relieve menopausal symptoms. 
`Osteoporosis_Therapy` : Treatments aimed at improving bone density and strength.
`Antidepressants` : Medications used to treat depression and related conditions.
`Procedure` : Medical procedures related to menopausal care. 
`Hormone_Testing` : Tests to measure hormone levels in the body. 
`Vaginal_Swab` : A diagnostic test involving a swab from the vaginal area. 
`Age` : The age of the patient.
`Test_Result` : Results from various medical tests. 
## Predicted Entities

`Perimenopause`, `Menopause`, `Gynecological_Symptom`, `Gynecological_Disease`, `Other_Symptom`, `Irregular_Menstruation`, `G_P`, `Hypertension`, `Osteoporosis`, `Oncological`, `Fracture`, `Hormone_Replacement_Therapy`, `Osteporosis_Therapy`, `Antidepressants`, `Procedure`, `Hormone_Testing`, `Vaginal_Swab`, `Age`, `Test_Result`
