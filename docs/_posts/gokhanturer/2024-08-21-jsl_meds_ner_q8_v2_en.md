## Description

This LLM model is trained to extract and link entities in a document. Users needs to define an input schema as explained in the example section. Drug is defined as a list which tells the model that there could be multiple drugs in the document and it has to extract all of them. Each drug has properties like `name` and `reaction`. Since name is only one, it is a string, but there could be multiple reactions, hence it is a list. Similarly, users can define any schema for any type of entity.
