## Description

This model  maps phenotypic abnormalities, medical terms associated with hereditary diseases, encountered in human to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes using `sbiobert_base_cased_mli` Sentence Bert Embeddings, and has faster load time, with a speedup of about 6X when compared to previous versions. Also the load process now is more memory friendly meaning that the maximum memory required during load time is smaller, reducing the chances of OOM exceptions, and thus relaxing hardware requirements.

## Predicted Entities

This model returns Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) codes for phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. It also returns associated codes from the following vocabularies for each HPO code: - MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)- SNOMED- UMLS (Unified Medical Language System ) - ORPHA (international reference resource for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs) - OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)
