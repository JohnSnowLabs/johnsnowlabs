## Description

This model is a [BioBERT](https://sparknlp.org/2023/09/13/biobert_base_cased_v1.2_en.html) based sentence classification model that can determine whether the clinical sentences include terms related to biomarkers or not.

## Predicted Entities

`1`: Contains biomarker related terms

`0`: Doesn't contain biomarker related terms

For instance, the expression levels of HER2/neu, a protein receptor, have been linked to aggressive forms of breast cancer. Additionally, the presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is often monitored to track the progression of prostate cancer. Moreover, in cardiovascular health, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) serves as a biomarker for inflammation and potential risk of heart disease. Meanwhile, elevated levels of troponin T are indicative of myocardial damage, commonly observed in acute coronary syndrome. In the field of diabetes management, glycated hemoglobin is a widely used to assess long-term blood sugar control. Its levels reflect the average blood glucose concentration over the past two to three months, offering valuable insights into disease management strategies."""]]).toDF("text")
