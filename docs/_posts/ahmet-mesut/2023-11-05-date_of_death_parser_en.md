SOCIAL HISTORY:
Jane Doe was born on November 4, 1962, in London, and she got married on April 5, 1979.
When she got pregnant on May 15, 1979, the doctor wanted to verify her date of birth, which was confirmed to be November 4, 1962.
Jane was 45 years old when she sadly passed away on September 25, 2007.

PROCEDURES:
Patient Jane Doe was evaluated on March 15, 1988, for allergies. She was seen by the endocrinology service and was discharged on September 23, 1988.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin 1 mg daily. Jane's last INR was measured on August 14, 2007, and it was 2.3."""
