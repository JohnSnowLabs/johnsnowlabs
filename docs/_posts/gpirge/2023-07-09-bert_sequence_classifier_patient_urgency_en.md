## Description

This Patient Urgency Text Classifier is for analyzing the emergency level of medical situations that require immediate assistance from the medical organizations.

The Text Classifier model has been trained on a collection of emergency calls that have been labeled with three different classes:

High: Requires immediate intervention, life-threatening or potentially life-threatening cases,

Medium: Requires intervention, urgent, not life-threatening cases.

Low: Non-urgent, needs treatment when time permits.

## Predicted Entities

`High`, `Medium`, `Low`
