## Description

This model is a BioBERT-based Adverse Event Text Classifier and it is trained for analyzing the adverse events of drugs mentioned in health documents. 

The Text Classifier model has been trained using in-house annotated health-related text that have been labeled with two different classes:

`True`: Text includes signs or symptoms that are unfavorable, unintended, and/or harmful in a patient who is administered a pharmaceutical product or medical device.

`False`: The patient did not experience something unfavorable during the course of treatment.

## Predicted Entities

`True`, `False`

I was reading here, that a lot of people has been losing weight and exercise and now they have a normal blood pressure. Please let me know, what I can do. The sides effects are horrible"],

I like socialising, been doing so for years now.Recently been getting this occasional pain from the liver area (under right ribs).It comes and goes. Could this be a sign of liver damage?When i get this pain i am usually in the pub drinking.If i press the area under my right rib cage about half way across i can feel pain. Is that pain in the Liver?"]
