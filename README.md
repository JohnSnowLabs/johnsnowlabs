## Installation

```python
! pip install johnsnowlabs

from johnsnowlabs import nlp
nlp.load('emotion').predict('Wow that was easy!')

```

See [the documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/install) for more details.



## Usage

These are examples of getting things done with one line of code.
See the [General Concepts Documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/concepts) for building custom pipelines.

```python
# Example of Named Entity Recognition
nlp.load('ner').predict("Dr. John Snow is an British physician born in 1813")
```

Returns :

| entities  | entities_class | entities_confidence | 
|-----------|----------------|:--------------------|
| John Snow | PERSON         | 0.9746              | 
| British   | NORP           | 0.9928              | 
| 1813      | DATE           | 0.5841              | 

```python

nlp.load('answer_question').predict("What is the capital of Paris")
```

Returns :

| text                          | answer | 
|-------------------------------|--------|
| What is the capital of France | Paris  | 

```python
# Example of Sentiment classification
nlp.load('sentiment').predict("Well this was easy!")
```

Returns :

| text                | sentiment_class | sentiment_confidence | 
|---------------------|-----------------|:---------------------|
| Well this was easy! | pos             | 0.999901             | 


```python

## Use Licensed Products

To use John Snow Labs' paid products like [Healthcare NLP](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare-nlp), [Visual NLP], [Legal NLP], or [Finance NLP], get a license key and then call nlp.install() to use it:



```python
! pip install johnsnowlabs
# Install paid libraries via a browser login to connect to your account
from johnsnowlabs import nlp
nlp.install()
# Start a licensed session
nlp.start()
nlp.load('en.med_ner.oncology_wip').predict("Woman is on  chemotherapy, carboplatin 300 mg/m2.")
```

## Usage 

These are examples of getting things done with one line of code.
See the [General Concepts Documentation](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/concepts) for building custom pipelines.


```python
# visualize entity resolution ICD-10-CM codes 
nlp.load('en.resolve.icd10cm.augmented')
    .viz('Patient with history of prior tobacco use, nausea, nose bleeding and chronic renal insufficiency.')
```
returns:        
![ner_viz_opensource](docs/assets/images/readme/ner_viz_oncology.png)



```python
# Temporal Relationship Extraction&Visualization
nlp.load('relation.temporal_events')\
    .viz('The patient developed cancer after a mercury poisoning in 1999 ')
```
returns:
![relationv_viz](docs/assets/images/readme/relationv_viz.png)
