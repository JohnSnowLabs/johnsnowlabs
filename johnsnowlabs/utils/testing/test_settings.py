Settings for the JSL-Notebook-Preprocessor

These settings are applied for Pre-Processing on Entire Notebook Cells.
One Notebook consists of multiple Cells and a Cell consists of Multiple Lines seperated by \n
There are 2 Levels of Settings :
Cell Based Rules : Treats entire Cell as a string and applies Rule
Line Based Settings : Applies rule to lines of code in cell individually.

Note:
Lines are derived by splitting on \n are not always valid python code, since actual code can be multi-line
