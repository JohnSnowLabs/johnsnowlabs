**Pacific AI**

**Overview**

John Snow Labs’ **Pacific.ai Test Suite** is an enterprise framework for
evaluating and validating large language models (LLMs) in **healthcare
and life sciences**. It provides a systematic, regulatory-focused
approach to benchmark models for **safety, accuracy, bias, robustness,
and compliance**. By unifying industry-specific evaluation metrics with
rigorous QA workflows, Pacific.ai ensures that medical AI systems meet
clinical standards and regulatory requirements before deployment. The
suite’s design emphasizes **patient safety and legal compliance**,
helping organizations detect issues (like factual errors or unsafe
outputs) early and document model performance for audits or approvals.
In essence, Pacific.ai Test Suite serves as a **“clinical grade”
validation layer** for LLMs – testing not just general performance, but
whether models behave **reliably, fairly, and in accordance with
healthcare regulations**.

**Use Cases**

Pacific.ai Test Suite supports a range of LLM validation use cases
across healthcare and life science settings:

- **Model Benchmarking & Validation**: Evaluate new foundation models or
  fine-tuned medical LLMs on domain-specific tasks (clinical Q&A,
  reasoning, etc.) to ensure they reach acceptable accuracy and safety
  levels before clinical use.

- **Clinical Information Extraction**: Validate models that extract
  facts from electronic health records (EHR) – e.g. identifying
  diagnoses, medications, or symptoms in notes – by comparing against
  expert-annotated datasets and measuring precision/recall.

- **De-Identification of PHI**: Test and certify de-identification
  pipelines for clinical text and medical images (e.g. DICOM) to ensure
  all Protected Health Information (PHI) is removed with **\>99%
  accuracy**, meeting HIPAA’s 0.01 tolerance for
  error[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794#:~:text=,but). The
  suite can ingest clinical notes, radiology reports, pathology images,
  etc., and verify that patient names, IDs, dates, and other identifiers
  are consistently masked.

- **Prompt Regression Testing**: For healthcare chatbots and decision
  support tools, Pacific.ai enables *prompt testing*– ensuring that
  updates to prompts or model versions do not introduce regressions. It
  can re-run a battery of curated test prompts (clinical scenarios, user
  queries) and flag any decline in correctness, coherence, or
  compliance.

- **Multilingual Model Validation**: Validate NLP pipelines in
  **multiple languages** – e.g. de-identification in German or French,
  or clinical named entity recognition in Spanish. The test suite
  leverages John Snow Labs’ libraries supporting 250+ languages to
  ensure models perform robustly across diverse patient populations.

- **Integration Testing in Workflows**: Pacific.ai integrates with MLOps
  and clinical IT workflows so that models can be evaluated in situ. For
  example, a hospital deploying an AI summarization service can use the
  suite to continuously monitor the model’s outputs on real-world data
  (under strict privacy rules) and catch any drift or performance
  issues. Test Suite results can feed into dashboards or CI/CD pipelines
  – only promoting a model to production when it passes all compliance
  checks. This supports **“validation-as-a-service”** within the
  organization’s existing data pipelines.

## **Key Features & Capabilities**

Pacific.ai Test Suite provides a comprehensive set of features for
**automated, transparent, and customizable** model evaluation:

- **Automated Benchmark Evaluations** – Out-of-the-box support for
  evaluating LLMs on standard **biomedical NLP benchmarks**. This
  includes question-answering and knowledge benchmarks like **PubMedQA,
  MedMCQA, BioASQ**, and others, as well as clinical NLP tasks (e.g.
  i2b2/n2c2 challenges). The suite can automatically run the model on
  these datasets and report accuracy metrics, enabling objective
  comparison to published results.

- **Hallucination & Factuality Monitoring** – Tools to detect
  **hallucinations** (fabricated statements) and measure factual
  accuracy. The Test Suite cross-checks model-generated answers against
  trusted sources or reference answers, flagging content that is
  unsupported. It quantifies a model’s **hallucination rate** and
  **factuality score** for given prompts or test sets (critical for
  clinical advice scenarios where incorrect information can be harmful).
  This helps ensure models like medical chatbots **“don’t make stuff
  up.”**

- **Bias and Toxicity Detection** – Integrated **bias testing** to
  uncover any unwanted biases or toxic tendencies in model outputs.
  Pacific.ai can generate synthetic test cases (using the open-source
  LangTest library) to probe the model’s responses for **fairness across
  demographics** (e.g. does it perform equally well for different ages,
  genders, ethnic groups?) and for **inappropriate content** (hate,
  profanity, etc.). These tests ensure the LLM meets ethical and
  professional standards expected in healthcare.

AI](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/automating-ai-governance-for-healthcare-applications-of-generative-ai-2/)

- **Prompt Regression & Pipeline Validation** – The suite supports
  **regression testing** for prompts, chains, or pipelines that
  incorporate LLMs. Teams can define expected outputs or acceptance
  criteria for a set of prompt-model pairs (for instance, a discharge
  summary should contain certain key facts). Pacific.ai will re-run
  these tests whenever the LLM or prompts are updated, automatically
  highlighting any deviations or failures. This is crucial for
  maintaining consistent quality in **deployed LLM-powered
  applications** as they evolve.

- **Integration with JSL Ecosystem** – Seamless integration with John
  Snow Labs’ existing healthcare AI platforms and models. Pacific.ai
  Test Suite works natively with **Spark NLP for Healthcare**, including
  its pre-trained models and pipelines for clinical NLP. It also
  interfaces with JSL’s **Medical LLMs** (e.g., the 7B and 3B
  healthcare-specific models) and tools like **DeepLens** (for medical
  conversational AI) and the **Generative AI Lab**. This means users can
  easily pull in a model from the GenAI Lab or Spark NLP, run a battery
  of Pacific.ai tests, and then deploy it if it passes – all within a
  unified workflow. The integration ensures that **NLP pipelines, LLMs,
  and even hybrid systems** (like an LLM with a symbolic post-processor)
  can be validated end-to-end.

- **Multilingual & Multimodal Support** – Out-of-the-box support for
  English and **250+ languages**, including non-Latin scripts and
  healthcare-specific dialects. The test suite leverages JSL’s
  multilingual NLP models to generate test data and validate outputs in
  languages from German and Spanish to Chinese. In addition, Pacific.ai
  can handle **multimodal data** in evaluations: for example, checking
  that a pipeline correctly de-identifies PHI both in text and inside
  DICOM image metadata or ensuring a vision-language model (e.g.
  radiology report generator) is producing safe text. This broad support
  reflects real-world needs where healthcare AI must work across diverse
  populations and data types.

- **Customizable Test Suites** – While Pacific.ai comes with many
  built-in tests and benchmarks, it also allows organizations to
  **define custom test cases and evaluation criteria**. Users can plug
  in their proprietary datasets (e.g., a curated set of internal QA
  pairs, or annotated clinical notes from their institution) to create
  an *organization-specific test suite*. They can also set custom
  thresholds or scoring methods to reflect what “pass” means for their
  use case. For example, a pharma company could create a specific set of
  prompts around drug safety and require that the model achieve 95%
  accuracy on those before deployment. All such custom tests are managed
  within the framework for consistency and repeatability.

- **Dashboards & Reporting** – Pacific.ai provides **web-based
  dashboards and detailed reports** for analyzing model performance and
  tracking improvements. These include error analysis tools to drill
  down into **which questions or inputs a model failed on**, model
  comparison views to see how different versions stack up, and automatic
  **audit trail generation**. Every test run is logged with its data,
  metrics, and model version, creating a transparent record for
  compliance. The reporting interface is designed for cross-functional
  use – AI engineers can inspect technical metrics, while compliance
  officers can see **high-level compliance indicators** (like “PHI
  detection: 99.5% F1” or “no policy violations detected”). *Example:*
  The screenshot below illustrates a Pacific.ai dashboard comparing a
  model’s performance on key metrics:

*Example Pacific.ai Test Suite dashboard showing key evaluation metrics
(model F1 accuracy, hallucination rate, factual correctness). Such
visualizations help stakeholders quickly assess if a model meets
performance and safety targets.*

## **Performance & Benchmarks**

Pacific.ai Test Suite has been applied to evaluate John Snow Labs’ own
models and industry models, with peer-reviewed results demonstrating
**state-of-the-art performance**:

- **PubMedQA Benchmark:** John Snow Labs’ Medical LLM (7 billion
  parameters) achieved **78.4% accuracy** on the PubMedQA biomedical
  question-answering test – outperforming even GPT-4 (which scored
  75.2%). This made it the **first 7B model to exceed GPT-4** on this
  challenge, which comprises over 200K research questions requiring
  reasoning over PubMed abstracts. The result showcases the Test Suite’s
  ability to validate that a much smaller specialized model can rival or
  beat a general-purpose giant on domain-specific tasks.

- **Clinical De-Identification:** In a head-to-head evaluation on a
  HIPAA de-identification task, John Snow Labs’ **Healthcare NLP**
  system attained **96% F1** in detecting PHI in clinical notes –
  significantly higher than Microsoft Azure’s 91%, AWS Comprehend’s 83%,
  and OpenAI’s GPT-4o model’s
  79%[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794#:~:text=,but). This
  **peer-reviewed benchmark (Text2Story@ECIR 2025)** demonstrated that
  JSL’s solution was the only one to reach “regulatory-grade” accuracy
  (error \<1%), even surpassing human expert
  performance[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794#:~:text=conducted%20at%20both%20entity,based).
  The Pacific.ai Suite was instrumental in measuring these rates and
  confirming JSL’s model as the top performer. Notably, because the
  suite also tracks false positives/negatives at the entity level, it
  enabled a detailed error audit, confirming *no critical PHI leaks*
  with the JSL approach.

- **Summarization Quality:** In blind tests with physicians, summaries
  of patient notes generated by JSL’s Medical LLM were preferred
  **nearly 2:1 over GPT-4’s** summaries. Pacific.ai facilitated this
  evaluation by orchestrating a study where clinicians rated anonymized
  outputs without knowing which model produced them. The results
  indicate the JSL model’s summaries were more relevant, concise, and
  clinically accurate. This also highlights that **lower hallucination
  rates** likely contributed to clinicians favoring the JSL summaries
  (since factual errors often cause summary rejection).

- **Cost Efficiency:** Pacific.ai doesn’t just assess quality – it also
  tracks **cost and efficiency metrics** of running models. One analysis
  showed that using John Snow Labs’ solution for de-identification is an
  order of magnitude more cost-effective than using GPT-4’s API for the
  same task. For example, processing 1 million clinical notes was
  estimated at **\$2,418** with JSL’s on-premise model, versus
  **\$21,400** with OpenAI’s GPT-4 API. This ~90% cost
  reduction[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794#:~:text=%2891%25%29%2C%20AWS%20%2883%25%29%2C%20and%20GPT,based)
  is partly due to avoiding per-token billing. Pacific.ai can
  incorporate such cost comparisons into its reports – crucial for
  budgeting in large deployments. It confirms that JSL’s approach
  delivers not only higher accuracy but also far greater scalability for
  routine clinical workloads.

Overall, these benchmark outcomes (all independently confirmed in
publications or competitions) give confidence that models passing
Pacific.ai’s evaluations are **best-in-class**. The Test Suite’s library
of benchmarks and metrics continues to grow, enabling ongoing
performance tracking as new LLMs or updates are released.

## **Deployment & Compliance**

The Pacific.ai Test Suite was built with **healthcare compliance and
real-world deployment** considerations in mind:

- **Auditable & Reproducible Pipelines:** Every evaluation in Pacific.ai
  is fully auditable – the exact dataset version, test cases, model
  parameters, and results are recorded. This allows regulatory and
  validation teams to **reproduce test runs** and inspect how a
  conclusion was reached. For instance, if a model is certified for
  release, one can produce a detailed report of all tests (with
  timestamps and outcomes) as evidence. The suite supports version
  control of test suites themselves, ensuring that any changes to
  testing protocols are tracked.

- **On-Premises and Air-Gapped Support:** Recognizing strict privacy
  requirements, the Test Suite can be deployed entirely **on-premises**,
  behind the healthcare provider’s firewall, or even in **air-gapped
  environments**with no internet connection. All necessary models and
  benchmarks can reside locally. This ensures **no sensitive data or
  prompts ever leave the secure network** during testing. Even for
  cloud-based hospital systems, Pacific.ai can run in a virtual private
  cloud with no external data sharing. This design meets the stringent
  IT security constraints of hospitals, pharma companies, and government
  health agencies.

- **No PHI Leaves the Environment:** The evaluation pipelines are
  designed so that any input patient data (e.g. notes used for model
  testing) and outputs remain in the user’s environment. *No PHI or
  model output is transmitted to JSL or any third party.* The suite uses
  local compute for everything – including large language model
  inference – so compliance with HIPAA is maintained. As an extra
  safeguard, all logs or intermediate files can be configured to exclude
  any PHI. In effect, Pacific.ai acts as an **in-house test harness**
  living within the organization’s protected data zone.

- **Regulatory Alignment (HIPAA, GDPR, EU AI Act)**: Pacific.ai Test
  Suite helps organizations align with emerging AI regulations. For
  healthcare AI under HIPAA, it supports the **Expert Determination**
  method by quantifying re-identification risk (e.g., measuring PHI
  recall rates to ensure “very small” risk) and providing documentation
  for compliance officers. Under GDPR, it can verify that models
  handling EU patient data do not output personal data (preventing
  illegal leakage). The suite’s design and reports are also **EU AI
  Act-ready** – focusing on metrics like transparency, accuracy, and
  robustness that the Act mandates. Notably, John Snow Labs’ solutions
  (including this suite) have been cited as **compliant with the EU AI
  Act’s requirements** for risk management and data governance.
  Pacific.ai generates many of the artifacts (audit trails, bias
  reports, etc.) needed for an AI system’s “technical documentation”
  under the Act.

- **Certification and Quality Management:** Pacific.ai can be integrated
  into an organization’s quality management system (QMS) for software
  validation. For example, if a hospital has an FDA or CE-marked AI
  tool, any updates to the model can be tested with Pacific.ai as part
  of change control. The reproducible test results and logs serve as
  **objective evidence** of safety and effectiveness, which is
  invaluable for regulatory audits or approvals. The Test Suite supports
  *continuous monitoring* as well – post-deployment, it can periodically
  sample model outputs and ensure no degradation (aligning with the
  draft EU AI Act requirement for ongoing monitoring of high-risk AI).

In summary, the Test Suite was engineered to **meet or exceed compliance
norms**. It ensures that evaluating an AI model for healthcare does not
itself create new privacy or security risks, and it outputs the
documentation needed for regulatory peace of mind.

## **Real-World Use Cases**

Pacific.ai Test Suite has already been leveraged in demanding real-world
projects, exemplifying its value in ensuring AI solutions are ready for
production:

- **Providence Health (Scalable De-Identification):** Providence, one of
  the largest U.S. health systems, applied Pacific.ai’s methodology to
  validate an automated pipeline for de-identifying **hundreds of
  millions of clinical notes** (ultimately targeting ~**2 billion
  notes** system-wide). Given the massive scale, even a 0.1% error rate
  could expose millions of PHI instances – so the bar for accuracy was
  extremely high. Pacific.ai enabled a **multi-phase validation**: (1)
  **Independent third-party certification** – a privacy expert used the
  suite’s reports to conduct a formal HIPAA Expert Determination,
  confirming the de-id output had \<1% re-identification risk. (2)
  **Bias and fairness testing** – Providence’s compliance team used
  Pacific.ai to stratify de-id accuracy by patient subgroups, verifying
  the model removed PHI equally well for all demographics (no hidden
  bias). (3) **Adversarial red-teaming** – an external security firm
  spent 90 days attempting to re-identify patients from the
  de-identified data, essentially stress-testing the pipeline’s
  robustness. None were successful, and the model’s accuracy remained
  \>99%. This comprehensive, *four-layer validation* gave Providence’s
  leadership and legal counsel confidence to deploy the solution and
  share de-identified data broadly, backed by formal certifications and
  audit logs. It stands as a flagship example of **regulatory-grade AI
  validation in practice** – turning a traditionally risky project into
  a legally defensible success.

- **Clinical Summarization & Q&A Evaluation:** A major academic medical
  center used Pacific.ai Test Suite to evaluate a new **clinical note
  summarization** LLM (John Snow Labs’ Medical LLM) versus GPT-4 and
  other baselines. The Test Suite provided a structured way to measure
  summary accuracy (by comparing to reference summaries and checking for
  omissions/errors) and have clinicians rate the readability and
  utility. The result was that the JSL Medical LLM’s summaries were
  consistently preferred, as noted earlier (nearly twice as often as
  GPT-4’s). Similarly, the hospital’s clinical QA team configured
  Pacific.ai to test the LLM on **clinical question-answering**: they
  input real-world questions (e.g. “What is the recommended treatment
  for X given patient’s condition Y?”) along with ground-truth answers
  from guidelines. The Test Suite scored the LLM’s answers on
  correctness and cited evidence. This process helped them identify a
  few failure modes (certain rare diseases where the model lacked
  knowledge) which are now being addressed. Overall, **Pacific.ai proved
  invaluable for a “human in the loop” evaluation**, letting doctors
  systematically assess and compare model outputs for tasks like
  summarization and Q&A before any live deployment.

- **Specialized AI Model Validation (HCC coding, Mental Health,
  Radiology)**: Pacific.ai has been used to validate models in **highly
  specialized healthcare domains**. For example, John Snow Labs’ team
  worked with a payer on an NLP model for **HCC coding** (identifying
  hierarchical condition categories in charts for risk adjustment). They
  built custom test sets of clinical notes with known codes and used
  Pacific.ai to ensure the model’s recall of relevant diagnoses met
  compliance for Medicare Advantage coding audits. In another case, a
  children’s hospital explored an AI model to flag **pediatric mental
  health concerns** in clinical text. Using Pacific.ai, they generated
  test scenarios (e.g. notes with subtle indications of depression or
  abuse) and measured the model’s detection rate, as well as checked for
  false positives that could cause alarm. This guided them in
  calibrating the model’s sensitivity before pilot use. Likewise, a
  radiology research group validated an LLM that **extracts findings
  from radiology reports** and suggests follow-up actions. Pacific.ai
  was configured with domain-specific metrics (like identifying critical
  findings) to verify the model was as reliable as radiologists in
  parsing reports. These examples illustrate the flexibility of the Test
  Suite: whether it’s **insurance billing codes, pediatric psychology,
  or imaging reports**, teams have successfully **plugged in custom data
  and evaluation criteria** to vet their models. The result is faster
  iteration and confident deployment in each niche use case.

Through these real-world deployments, Pacific.ai Test Suite has
consistently helped **de-risk AI adoption**: catching issues early,
providing evidence of model quality, and instilling trust among
clinicians, compliance officers, and other stakeholders that the AI
solutions perform as intended.
