**Oncology Data Extraction Overview**

**Overview**

John Snow Labs’ **Oncology Data Extraction** platform is an end-to-end
solution for structuring cancer patient data from unstructured text. It
leverages domain-specific natural language processing (NLP) models and
medical large language models (LLMs) to transform free-text oncology
documents – pathology reports, radiology impressions, clinical notes,
genomics reports, trial protocols, discharge summaries – into
**analysis-ready, structured data**. Oncology is one of healthcare’s
most information-dense and complex domains, with critical details
(diagnoses, **AJCC TNM staging**, histology, biomarkers, treatments,
outcomes) often buried in narrative text. This solution is
**purpose-built for oncology**, trained on cancer-specific vocabulary
and patterns, to ensure that no vital tumor or treatment detail is lost
in translation. By applying specialized named entity recognition,
relation extraction, assertion detection, and ontology mapping, the
platform converts unstructured oncology narratives into auditable data
suitable for registries, analytics, and decision support

Designed for **clinical and research teams in oncology**, the platform
addresses the needs of tumor registry abstractors, oncology informatics
analysts, RWE/HEOR researchers, clinical trial teams, and cancer center
IT departments. It provides *enterprise-grade accuracy and compliance*:
delivering reproducible results at scale within a HIPAA-compliant
infrastructure. The extracted data can feed downstream applications such
as patient timeline visualization, cohort querying, outcomes analysis,
and real-time clinical decision support – all while ensuring patient
privacy and alignment with oncology guidelines. John Snow Labs’ solution
integrates seamlessly with the rest of the JSL ecosystem (Healthcare NLP
library, Visual NLP, Patient Journey, Terminology Server), enabling
organizations to **unlock the full value of oncology data** that was
previously unstructured and underutilized.

**Use Cases**

Oncology Data Extraction supports a wide range of high-impact use cases
in cancer care and research:

- **Automated Tumor Registry Population:** Extracts primary tumor site,
  histological subtype, grade, stage, receptor status (e.g.
  “ER-positive, HER2-negative”) and other required fields from pathology
  and oncology notes to **auto-populate cancer registries**. This
  reduces manual chart abstraction effort by over 70% while improving
  data consistency.

- **Clinical Trial Cohort Matching:** Identifies patients eligible for
  trials by parsing unstructured notes for inclusion/exclusion criteria.
  For example, it can find patients with *“EGFR L858R-mutant stage IV
  NSCLC”* by detecting the mutation, cancer type, and stage in text,
  then matching against protocol criteria. This accelerates **cohort
  building and eligibility screening**, enabling trial recruiters to
  find candidates in minutes instead of weeks.

- **Real-World Evidence & Outcomes Research:** Enables life sciences
  teams to curate **RWE datasets** from EHR notes, stratifying patients
  by biomarkers, treatments, and outcomes. Researchers can extract
  longitudinal data (e.g. therapies received, response assessments,
  progression events) to study comparative effectiveness. For instance,
  a study of *ALK-positive vs EGFR-mutated lung cancer* patients can
  automatically gather cohorts and outcomes from text, rather than
  manual review.

- **Guideline Compliance & Quality Monitoring:** Flags cases where care
  deviates from clinical guidelines or quality measures. The system can
  detect if a *“Stage III colon cancer”* patient’s note says “no
  adjuvant therapy planned” and automatically **alert a quality
  officer**. This helps ensure treatments align with NCCN guidelines and
  institutional protocols by surfacing exceptions in real time.

- **Adverse Event Surveillance:** Extracts mentions of chemotherapy
  toxicities and adverse events (e.g. *“Grade 3 neutropenia”*,
  *“immune-related colitis”*) from oncologist progress notes. By linking
  drugs to side effects, the platform enables **pharmacovigilance** and
  safety monitoring across patient populations. High-severity events
  trigger alerts so that care teams can intervene promptly.

LLMs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/ai-enhanced-oncology-data-unlocking-insights-from-ehrs-with-nlp-and-llms-2/#:~:text=)

- **Tumor Board & Longitudinal Patient Summaries:** Summarizes a
  patient’s journey – diagnoses, treatments, scans, outcomes – into a
  structured timeline that oncology care teams or tumor boards can
  easily review. This **patient journey timeline** provides a holistic
  view of each case, aligning data from pathology, radiology, labs, and
  clinic notes. It ensures that clinicians have the right information
  (e.g. latest biomarker status or therapy response) at their fingertips
  when making treatment decisions

**Key Features & Capabilities**

The Oncology Data Extraction solution offers specialized features that
work in concert to handle the nuances of cancer data:

- **Oncology-Specific Entity Extraction:** Advanced medical NLP models
  accurately identify **key cancer entities** in text. These include
  primary tumor types and anatomical sites (e.g. *“invasive ductal
  carcinoma of the left breast”*), histological subtypes and grades,
  cancer biomarkers/mutations (e.g. *EGFR L858R, PD-L1 expression*),
  **TNM staging** (tumor/node/metastasis mentions like *T2N1M0*),
  disease laterality (left/right), and prognosis or response terms. The
  platform uses a dedicated oncology NER (Named Entity Recognition)
  model that labels spans as TUMOR_TYPE, ANATOMICAL_SITE, STAGE,
  BIOMARKER, METASTASIS, THERAPY, RESPONSE, etc. – over **40
  oncology-specific entity categories** covering diagnoses, findings,
  and treatments. This is complemented by general clinical NER models
  for related entities like symptoms, medications, and procedures,
  ensuring comprehensive information extraction from each note.

- **Treatment Event Capture & Timeline Construction:** Beyond
  identifying entities, the system captures **oncology treatment events
  and timelines** from unstructured text. It extracts therapeutic
  procedures (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy
  lines), along with dates and sequencing, to reconstruct the patient’s
  treatment chronology. Temporal relation models detect event timing and
  ordering (diagnosis → treatment → recurrence) and link treatments to
  dates or cycles. For example, it can parse that *“Started FOLFOX on
  01/15/2024 after surgery in Dec 2023”*. It also identifies **disease
  progression or relapse** events (e.g. “new metastatic lesion noted in
  follow-up scan”) to place on the timeline. The result is a structured
  **patient journey** representation that tracks each diagnosis and
  intervention over time – a critical capability for longitudinal
  analysis and care planning.

- **Relation Extraction & Contextualization:** The platform doesn’t just
  find individual facts; it understands relationships between them. A
  **relation extraction** component links entities to form meaningful
  triples – for instance, connecting a tumor diagnosis to its stage
  (*“Breast carcinoma” → has_stage → “Stage IIIC”*), or a gene biomarker
  to its test result (*“ALK mutation” → has_result→ “positive”*). It
  captures drug–event relations as well (e.g. *“Alectinib” → caused →
  “bradycardia”*) to document adverse outcomes. These relations are
  normalized to a common schema, so downstream systems know which tumor
  the stage refers to, or which medication caused which side effect. The
  system also applies **assertion status detection** on relevant
  entities – marking whether a finding is present, negated, or
  conditional. For example, *“No evidence of metastasis”* will record
  *metastasis=false* for that patient, ensuring that negated findings
  are not falsely counted. Historical and hypothetical statements are
  also handled. This contextual understanding is crucial for **clinical
  accuracy**, preventing false positives and linking each extracted fact
  to the correct context (e.g., distinguishing a current tumor vs. a
  prior cancer in remission).

- **Terminology Normalization to Medical Standards:** Every extracted
  element can be mapped to standard **oncology codes and ontologies**
  for interoperability. The solution includes built-in terminologies and
  entity resolvers to normalize mentions to codes such as **ICD-O-3**
  (oncology morphology and topography codes), **SNOMED CT** clinical
  terms, **LOINC** lab test codes (for biomarkers and lab results), and
  the NCI **OncoTree** taxonomy or NCI Thesaurus for cancer types and
  mutations. For example, a raw text of “invasive ductal carcinoma of
  breast” is normalized to ICD-O code 8500/3 (Ductal carcinoma,
  invasive) and SNOMED CT concept 254837009. Staging phrases (like “T2a
  N1 M0 stage II”) can be mapped to structured stage groupings per
  **AJCC** definitions. The system also supports mapping to **OMOP**
  common data model tables for outcomes research and to **CDISC SDTM**
  format for clinical trial data exchange, enabling seamless integration
  of extracted data into analytics pipelines. Using the JSL
  **Terminology Server**, all entity outputs can be automatically
  resolved to their standard codes with versioning, which is invaluable
  for downstream analysis, population studies, or regulatory submission
  of real-world data. This normalization ensures the extracted data is
  not only accurate, but also **immediately usable in databases and
  analytics**.

- **Cohort Querying and Guideline Matching:** Extracted and normalized
  data can be queried and analyzed with ease. The platform supports
  **cohort building** via both SQL and natural language queries. After
  patient data is structured (for example, loaded into an OMOP CDM or
  similar schema), clinicians or analysts can query it using plain
  language (with the help of a conversational LLM interface) – e.g.,
  *“Find patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who received
  trastuzumab and later had brain metastases”*. The system translates
  such queries into precise database filters (leveraging Terminology
  Server for mapping terms to codes). This empowers clinical teams to
  perform **ad-hoc cohort discovery** or outcomes queries without
  needing IT support. Additionally, the solution can align patient data
  with **clinical guidelines**. By integrating curated guidelines (such
  as NCCN treatment guidelines) and using the extracted patient data, it
  can automatically identify care gaps or recommend next steps. For
  instance, it can highlight that a patient’s profile matches a scenario
  where adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated by NCCN guidelines, if not
  already given. Roche’s implementation of this system links query
  results to the most relevant NCCN guideline sections to support
  evidence-based planning. This **guideline matching** accelerates
  clinical decision support by ensuring that each patient’s structured
  data is cross-referenced with the latest oncology best practices.

- **Integration with JSL Ecosystem & Extensibility:** The Oncology Data
  Extraction product is not a standalone black box – it’s built on John
  Snow Labs’ proven stack and integrates with complementary tools:

  - *Healthcare NLP Library:* It leverages the full Spark NLP for
    Healthcare library with over **2,500** clinical NLP models and
    pipelines, including 100+ pretrained NER models and 50+ relation
    extraction models. This includes general clinical models (for labs,
    drugs, procedures, demographics) that work alongside the
    oncology-specific models. Users can also **fine-tune or extend**
    models with their own data – e.g., training a new entity for a
    proprietary biomarker or a new classification model – to
    continuously improve performance on local documents.

- *Visual NLP for OCR:* The platform integrates optical character
  recognition for any scanned documents or images (e.g. faxed pathology
  reports or PDF radiology files). John Snow Labs’ Visual NLP components
  can ingest PDFs or TIFFs, perform high-accuracy OCR, and feed the text
  into the NLP pipeline. This ensures that **images and scanned reports
  are no barrier** – their content is extracted and included. The system
  can even handle radiology images or pathology slides via Visual NLP
  models (for example, detecting that a pathology slide is positive for
  tumor) if such capabilities are needed, combining vision and text AI.

- *Patient Journey Module:* Structured outputs (diagnoses, treatments,
  timelines) can feed into JSL’s **Patient Journey** solution, which
  automatically assembles multimodal patient data into a longitudinal
  record. The oncology NLP pipeline’s outputs are designed to integrate
  into an **OMOP-compliant data store** for patient journeys, enabling
  organization-wide analytics across the continuum of care. This
  integration means a hospital can plug the NLP output directly into
  their population health or outcomes research databases.

- *Compliance and Security Tools:* It also works hand-in-hand with JSL’s
  de-identification modules if needed – for example, de-identifying
  notes before processing, or anonymizing outputs for research use. And
  because it’s built on the JSL platform, it inherits robust **audit
  logging, versioning, and monitoring capabilities**.

Overall, the solution is **extensible and customizable** – new rules or
models can be added for site-specific needs, and it can be configured to
integrate with existing data pipelines (e.g., ingesting notes from an
EHR system and outputting to an analytics database). This flexibility
ensures that it can fit the unique workflows of different oncology
centers and research groups.

**Performance & Benchmarks**

John Snow Labs’ Oncology Data Extraction has demonstrated
**industry-leading accuracy** and efficiency in published evaluations
and real-world deployments. Key performance highlights include:

- **State-of-the-Art Extraction Accuracy:** The oncology-tuned NLP
  models consistently achieve very high precision and recall on
  domain-specific tasks. In one benchmark, a JSL oncology information
  extraction pipeline exceeded **94% accuracy** extracting cancer
  findings from lung cancer radiology reports – whereas a general LLM
  (GPT-4) reached only ~82% on the same task. This ~12 percentage-point
  gap highlights the benefit of specialized models for oncology.
  Similarly, JSL’s models for oncology NER have been rigorously
  benchmarked to meet clinical precision standards often attaining
  **F1-scores above 0.90** for key entities in annotated test sets.

[AI-Driven Oncology Insights: Unlocking Data from EHRs with NLP and
LLMs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/ai-driven-oncology-insights-unlocking-data-from-ehrs-with-nlp-and-llms/#:~:text=Generic%20LLMs%20often%20lack%20the,outputs%20that%20accelerate%20oncology%20workflows),

- **High Recall of Treatments & Adverse Events:** The platform excels at
  capturing treatment details and safety outcomes. For example, in an
  adverse event extraction evaluation, it achieved **F1 ≈ 0.93** (95%
  recall, 91% precision) in identifying chemotherapy-related toxicities
  from clinical narratives. This means it caught the vast majority of
  documented side effects, with very few false alarms – a performance
  level approaching expert human abstraction. In a clinical trial
  matching scenario, a hybrid NLP+LLM approach using this platform
  reached an F1 of **0.81** in identifying eligible patients, markedly
  outperforming traditional manual or rules-based methods. These metrics
  translate to real-world impact: higher recall ensures critical patient
  events or candidates are not missed, and high precision minimizes
  unnecessary follow-up.

- **Dramatic Improvements in Data Completeness:** Deploying the solution
  has shown **significant gains in captured data** compared to relying
  on structured EHR fields alone. In one oncology data curation project,
  integrating JSL’s NLP increased the documentation of key cancer
  variables by large margins – **histology data increased by 67.5%**,
  metastatic disease documentation by 39.9%, cancer stage by 19.5%, ER
  receptor status by 34.9%, and BRAF mutation mentions by 81.5%.
  Overall, across all oncology data elements captured, the project saw
  up to **80% more data** after applying the NLP pipeline. This means
  researchers and registrars had nearly twice as much usable
  information, drawn from text that would otherwise be lost. Such
  completeness is crucial for real-world evidence studies and for
  providing a full picture of the patient journey.

- **Efficiency and Scalability:** The platform drastically reduces
  manual labor and time-to-insights. A typical hospital tumor registry
  that may require manual review of thousands of notes can be processed
  automatically in hours. In one case, **manual chart review effort
  dropped by 70%** when an academic cancer center switched to automated
  extraction for registry entry. Another head-to-head test on clinical
  trial patient matching showed that the NLP solution could find trial
  candidates with far greater precision than a legacy system (57% vs 5%
  precision), **saving ~10 hours of chart review per trial** in that
  sample

. The solution is optimized for scale – using Spark NLP under the hood –
capable of processing millions of documents, either in batch or
streaming, on commodity hardware or cloud clusters. Internal benchmarks
have shown that it can parse **1 million clinical notes for under
\$2,500 in infrastructure cost** while outperforming cloud NLP APIs that
would cost an order of magnitude more.

- **Outperforms General-Purpose Models:** Compared to generic NLP
  solutions (including big-name cloud services and chatGPT-like models),
  John Snow Labs’ oncology models make **far fewer errors on clinical
  text**. Independent comparisons have found Spark NLP’s clinical NER
  makes **4–6× fewer errors** than AWS, Azure, or Google on medical
  entity extraction. Specifically for oncology entities, one study noted
  Spark NLP achieved 0.84 F1 on an oncology entity set versus 0.45 by
  ChatGPT – nearly doubling the performance. The JSL models are also
  **more consistent** – they produce the same results every run given
  the same input (critical for regulated use), whereas large LLMs can
  vary by prompt or session. This reliability and transparency (with
  published benchmarks and model info) give clinicians and regulators
  confidence in the results.

*(All the above benchmarks are from peer-reviewed studies, public case
studies, or internal evaluations documented by John Snow Labs. They
illustrate that the Oncology Data Extraction solution delivers
cutting-edge accuracy while remaining cost-effective and scalable.)*

**Deployment & Compliance**

John Snow Labs designed this platform with **healthcare-grade deployment
flexibility and regulatory compliance** in mind. Organizations can
deploy and use Oncology Data Extraction with full control over data and
workflows:

- **Flexible Deployment Options:** The solution can be deployed
  on-premises, in a private cloud, or in a hybrid architecture,
  depending on the organization’s needs. All JSL NLP libraries run in
  the customer’s environment (on servers or VMs) and **do not require
  sending data to any outside service**. This ensures data sovereignty –
  a critical factor for hospitals and pharma companies. Deployment is
  supported on major platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, Kubernetes,
  etc.). For example, one pharma integrated it within their **Navify**
  platform across global care teams. John Snow Labs offers containerized
  packages and “**floating licenses**” to make installation and scaling
  straightforward in enterprise settings. The NLP pipelines can be
  called as REST APIs or used directly in Spark/Databricks environments,
  enabling integration into ETL jobs, clinical data warehouses, or real
  time processing streams. In short, the technology can **scale from a
  single server to a cluster**, and process documents in parallel to
  meet throughput requirements – whether it’s a batch of 100M pathology
  reports or interactive queries on new notes.

- **Security & Privacy:** The platform is built to meet strict
  healthcare privacy regulations like **HIPAA** and GDPR. **Protected
  Health Information (PHI)** never leaves the customer’s infrastructure
  – all processing happens in-memory on the client’s machines. The
  software does not log or transmit any patient text externally.
  Moreover, John Snow Labs provides certified de-identification
  components that can be used in tandem if needed (to redact or
  anonymize PHI in notes). The system supports role-based access control
  and encryption as per enterprise standards. It has been deployed in
  environments vetted for HITRUST, ISO 27001, and other compliance
  regimes. In a published project, the solution ran in a HIPAA-compliant
  cloud setup (AWS/Azure) with **automatic data anonymization** to
  ensure no privacy breach. This built-in compliance focus allows
  healthcare and life science organizations to adopt AI for oncology
  **with confidence that patient confidentiality and legal requirements
  are upheld**.

- **Regulatory-Grade Traceability:** The Oncology Data Extraction
  pipelines produce **deterministic and auditable outputs**, which is
  essential for regulated use-cases (e.g. supporting an FDA submission
  with RWE, or populating a registry for accreditation). Each model and
  pipeline is versioned; organizations can lock down versions for
  validation and get detailed change logs for new releases. The outputs
  can include trace information – for instance, offset mappings to
  source documents – so that any extracted data point can be traced back
  to the original text and context. Regulators and clinicians often
  require this level of explainability. Unlike black-box AI services,
  JSL’s solution allows **complete audit trails**. As noted by the CTO
  of John Snow Labs, regulators prefer deterministic outputs, whereas
  general LLMs can vary from run to run. With this platform, an
  extraction run today or next year (with the same model version and
  input) will yield the same results, enabling consistent verification.
  Additionally, JSL’s **team and support** can assist with validation
  documentation, and the software has been successfully audited in
  clinical settings.

- **Standards Compliance & Integration:** The platform natively supports
  healthcare data standards, easing integration with clinical systems.
  Extracted data can be output in **HL7 FHIR** resources or **OMOP** CDM
  tables to integrate with existing data warehouses. It can also
  generate **CDISC SDTM** domains for clinical trial integrations,
  streamlining the flow of unstructured data into clinical study
  databases. The use of standard terminologies (SNOMED, ICD-O, UMLS,
  etc.) means the structured output aligns with coding standards used in
  EHRs and registries. This not only ensures semantic interoperability,
  but also reduces the downstream work needed to use the data. The
  solution is compatible with major EMR systems and can be configured to
  ingest notes from HL7 interfaces or export results into databases,
  CSV, or JSON as needed. **Deployment architecture** can be tailored –
  e.g., as a nightly batch process updating a data mart, or as real-time
  microservices that process notes on arrival. John Snow Labs also
  provides containerized “**Healthcare NLP Server**” options that turn
  pipelines into scalable APIs, and supports Kubernetes for
  orchestration (thereby simplifying enterprise IT management). In
  summary, the platform fits within existing IT ecosystems and meets
  **healthcare IT standards**, from security to data format, which helps
  CIOs and compliance officers sleep at night.

**Real-World Use Cases**

John Snow Labs’ Oncology Data Extraction is already powering
cutting-edge projects at leading institutions. Here are a few
illustrative real-world implementations:

- **Roche Diagnostics – Automated Oncology Timelines:** Roche’s **Navify
  Oncology Hub** (a digital platform for oncology workflows) uses JSL’s
  NLP and LLM technology to automatically **extract patient timelines**
  for cancers such as breast, ovarian, and skin cancer. In this
  deployment, pathology reports, radiology notes, and clinician notes
  are processed to pull out diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes over
  time. The system merges redundant mentions (e.g. linking “left breast
  tumor” with later references to “the tumor”) and infers temporal
  relations, producing a clean timeline for each patient. This enabled
  Roche to reduce manual data abstraction efforts in assembling oncology
  patient journeys. The extracted structured data is then used to build
  cohort queries and even to drive a “Smart Navigation” feature:
  clinicians can ask questions in natural language and get cohort
  results, which the system then aligns with relevant NCCN guideline
  recommendations. Roche reported that this approach not only scaled to
  handle thousands of patients, but it also aligned treatment decisions
  with up-to-date guidelines in real time. This is a prime example of
  how an industry leader applied the platform for **longitudinal patient
  insight and decision support**.

- **MiBA Collaboration – Oncology Data Curation and LLMs:** John Snow
  Labs partnered with MiBA (an oncology analytics initiative) to build
  an **AI-enhanced oncology data pipeline** for real-world data. In this
  project, they integrated JSL’s NLP with large language models to
  extract and reconcile data from EHR notes across multiple hospitals.
  The pipeline ingests structured data (e.g. diagnosis codes, labs) and
  unstructured notes/PDFs (using OCR), then uses JSL’s pre-trained
  models to perform entity and relationship extraction with an average
  F1 around 0.90. The result was a unified, more complete oncology
  dataset that updated nightly. The impact was striking: after deploying
  the NLP pipeline, **histology documentation increased by ~67%**,
  metastatic disease info by ~40%, and certain biomarker data (e.g. BRAF
  mutations) by over 80%. In terms of outcomes, this richer dataset
  enabled better clinical trial matching – the team demonstrated an **F1
  of 0.81** for trial eligibility identification, far above previous
  methods. It also improved adverse event detection (recall 0.95,
  precision 0.91) for pharmacovigilance in oncology. **Bottom line:** By
  combining JSL’s robust NLP with domain-specific LLM reasoning, the
  MiBA project showed significant improvements in data quality and
  actionable insight generation for oncology research and care.

- **Hospital Tumor Registry Automation:** A large cancer center in the
  United States implemented the Oncology Data Extraction platform to
  streamline its tumor registry operations. Previously, registry
  abstractors manually combed through pathology reports and clinical
  notes to find details like primary site, histology, tumor stage,
  laterality, and biomarker statuses for each cancer case – a
  time-consuming process. With JSL’s solution, these unstructured
  documents are processed automatically: e.g., a pathology note stating
  *“Diagnosis: Invasive adenocarcinoma, right lung, upper lobe, EGFR
  exon 19 deletion, Stage IIA”* is instantly parsed into structured
  fields (topography = lung upper lobe, morphology = adenocarcinoma,
  laterality = right, EGFR = positive exon 19 deletion, stage = IIA).
  The system also captures important context from subsequent clinical
  notes (like *“Started osimertinib after surgery”* indicating targeted
  therapy given). This automated pipeline fed the registry database
  directly. The **result was a 70% reduction in manual chart review
  time** for registry staff, who could then focus on verifying and
  analyzing the data rather than hunting for it. Data completeness
  improved as well – fewer staging or biomarker fields were left
  “unknown” because the NLP found mentions that staff might miss under
  workload pressure. The hospital reported faster registry submissions
  and the ability to **expand the registry’s scope** (tracking more data
  points, more patients) without adding staff, thanks to the efficiency
  of the NLP extraction.

- **Clinical Trial Enrollment at an Academic Medical Center:** An
  academic research hospital used the platform to identify and notify
  patients eligible for a genomics-driven clinical trial. The trial
  sought patients with *“KRAS G12C mutation-positive non-small cell lung
  cancer, stage III or IV, who have progressed after first-line
  therapy.”*Instead of manual chart screening, the hospital set up an
  automated search: the NLP pipeline scanned pathology and molecular
  diagnostics reports for **KRAS G12C** mutation mentions and lung
  cancer diagnoses, checked oncology notes for staging information (III
  or IV), and even noted therapy timelines to see if first-line therapy
  was completed. This information was then aggregated per patient. The
  outcome was a **nightly roster of candidates**: a list of patients
  (with encounter details) meeting the criteria, generated by the
  system. Oncologists could review this AI-generated list each morning
  to confirm eligibility and then reach out to the patients for the
  trial. This approach dramatically accelerated trial recruitment – what
  used to require weeks of manual chart review by a research coordinator
  was accomplished in hours with higher consistency. It also uncovered
  patients who might have been overlooked, by sifting through notes from
  different departments (e.g., genetics consult notes, progress notes,
  etc.). In short, the center leveraged the platform for **real-time
  clinical trial matching**, demonstrating how it can directly impact
  trial enrollment and translational research.

- **Quality Improvement & Guideline Adherence:** A multi-hospital
  oncology network applied the data extraction system to monitor
  treatment decisions against national guidelines. One use-case was
  ensuring that all **Stage III colon cancer** patients receive
  guideline-recommended adjuvant chemotherapy. The NLP pipeline
  extracted the cancer stage and any mention of adjuvant therapy plans
  from post-surgery notes. It then ran a simple rule: if stage ≥ III and
  no adjuvant therapy found (or a phrase like “no chemo recommended”),
  flag the case. During a pilot, this approach flagged several charts
  where patients hadn’t received chemo due to various reasons (some
  appropriate, some potential oversights). The oncology quality
  committee could then review these cases in detail. This **targeted
  review** is far more efficient than manually scanning every Stage III
  case, and it provides a safety net to catch possible deviations. The
  platform’s accuracy in extracting stage and treatment plans was key to
  making this a reliable process. The network plans to extend this
  approach to other measures, such as checking if G-CSF growth factors
  were used when high-risk chemo was given, etc. It illustrates how
  **AI-driven text extraction supports quality and compliance**
  initiatives in oncology, improving care standards.

- **Pharmaceutical RWE and HEOR Analyses:** Top biopharmaceutical
  companies are leveraging John Snow Labs’ technology to harness
  real-world oncology data at scale. In one case study, Roche (a global
  pharma leader) used Spark NLP for Healthcare to **extract and
  normalize tumor characteristics** (like mutation status, prior
  therapies, tumor burden) from thousands of pathology and radiology
  reports across their clinical trial sites. This enabled Roche to build
  a rich real-world dataset to complement clinical trial data,
  supporting outcomes research and health economics models with far more
  granular detail than structured data alone provided. More broadly, **5
  of the world’s top 10 pharma companies** have used John Snow Labs NLP
  in their real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE)
  initiatives. These projects include everything from automating
  clinical **chart review for outcomes studies**, to **mining patient
  support program notes for insights**, to **accelerating
  pharmacovigilance case processing**. The common theme is that the
  Oncology Data Extraction capabilities allow pharma to convert
  unstructured text into quantitative data for analysis, at a scale and
  accuracy not achievable with manual processes. This has led to faster
  generation of evidence on drug performance, safety, and value in
  actual clinical practice – informing publications, reimbursement
  dossiers, and internal decision-making with high-quality real-world
  data.

**Customer Proof Points**

Organizations that have adopted John Snow Labs’ Oncology Data Extraction
report measurable improvements in productivity and outcomes:

- **70% Reduction in Manual Abstraction Effort:** A hospital tumor
  registry project saw a \>70% drop in manual chart review time by using
  the automated extraction pipeline. Nurses and abstractors could
  reallocate time from data hunting to data analysis, allowing the
  registry to cover more patients without additional staff.

- **Significantly More Complete Data:** In a multi-site oncology data
  curation initiative, integrating the JSL NLP pipeline yielded **67–81%
  increases** in capturing critical cancer data points (histology,
  mutations, etc.) from clinical text. Overall data completeness
  improved by ~80%, meaning clinicians and researchers had nearly twice
  the information available compared to using structured EHR fields
  alone. This directly translates to more robust analysis and insights.

- **Higher Precision Than Generic AI:** In head-to-head evaluations,
  John Snow Labs’ oncology models have **made 5–6× fewer errors** than
  general large language models or cloud NLP APIs on clinical entity
  extraction. For example, in extracting oncology-related entities, a
  domain-tuned JSL model achieved 0.84 F1 vs 0.45 by ChatGPT in one
  test. This gap underscores the solution’s reliability in real clinical
  text, avoiding the hallucinations and omissions seen with general AI.

- **Superior Trial Matching Performance:** In a real-world trial
  recruitment test (Elaine III breast cancer trial), an AI workflow
  using JSL’s extraction achieved **precision of ~57% vs only 5%** for
  an existing commercial system – identifying nearly all true matches
  with few false positives

. It was able to find eligible patients the same day a query was run,
saving an estimated 10+ hours of manual screening per trial. This high
precision and speed can accelerate clinical studies and reduce
enrollment costs.

- **Adverse Events Captured at 95% Recall:** The system’s ability to
  find oncology adverse events in narrative notes has been validated
  with **95% sensitivity**. High recall ensures patient safety signals
  (like severe toxicities or complications) are not missed. One oncology
  pharmacovigilance team reported that the NLP found dozens of adverse
  events that had been under-reported, enabling timely interventions.

- **Enterprise Adoption & Trust:** John Snow Labs’ solutions, including
  this oncology platform, are used by some of the most respected names
  in healthcare and life sciences. This includes major cancer centers,
  academic medical centers, and **pharma companies (5 of the top 10
  globally)**. For example, Roche publicly shared their success using
  JSL NLP to drive real-world evidence generation in oncology, citing
  its state-of-the-art accuracy and the fact that it continuously
  improves with new research. Such endorsements reflect the trust placed
  in the platform for high-stakes applications. Clients also appreciate
  JSL’s support for compliance (e.g., one customer noted how smoothly
  the solution fit into their HIPAA-compliant workflow). The growing
  list of **customer case studies and peer-reviewed papers** around John
  Snow Labs’ oncology NLP attests to its proven value in real clinical
  environments.

By choosing John Snow Labs for oncology data extraction, organizations
are seeing faster insights, greater efficiency, and more confidence in
the quality of their data. These proof points demonstrate tangible ROI –
from time saved and charts processed to discoveries made possible by AI
– and they underline why this solution is becoming a cornerstone for
data-driven oncology.
