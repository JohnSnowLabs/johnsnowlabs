**Legal NLP**

**Overview**

A domain-optimized NLP library for legal texts – contracts, filings,
regulations. It provides pre-trained models to extract legal entities
(parties, contract dates, clause types), classify clauses (e.g.,
confidentiality, indemnification), and link terms to legal ontologies.
It also includes document classifiers and assertion status models for
legal context (obligations, rights).

**Key Features & Capabilities**

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detects legal entities such as
  parties, dates, document types, aliases, and more within contracts,
  subpoenas, and filings.

- **Relation & Assertion Extraction:** Identifies relationships between
  entities and determines assertion statuses (e.g., obligation present,
  right granted, negation, temporality) in context.

- **Clause Classification & Summarization:** Recognizes 300+ clause
  types (e.g., confidentiality, indemnification, termination) and
  includes a domain-specific summarizer trained on ~8,000 legal
  agreement sections.

- **Contractual Natural Language Inference (NLI):** Classifies pairs of
  legal statements into entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.

- **Legal De-identification:** Detects and masks PHI/PII in both text
  and scanned images, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

- **Visual NLP Integration:** Performs OCR, table detection, and
  signature extraction from legal forms and scanned agreements.

- **Zero-shot & Multilingual Support:** Enables zero-shot NER and
  relation extraction without domain-specific training data and supports
  multilingual models (English, German, French, Greek, Turkish, and
  more).

- **Scalable Architecture:** Spark-based, deployable on AWS, Azure,
  Databricks, or on-premise.

**Performance Highlights & Benchmarks**

- **Document classification:** 96% accuracy in classifying different
  document types, such as contracts, SEC filings, and court filings.

- **ID card extraction**: 87% accuracy;

- **Mailing address extraction**: 89% accuracy.

- **Legal summarization:** Models trained on 8,000+ agreement sections,
  optimized for high information retention.

- **Clause classification:** 95% average accuracy across 300+ clause
  types (e.g., confidentiality, indemnification, termination).

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** 92%+ accuracy for extracting
  parties, dates, and document types.

- **Entity Resolution**: Links company names to official EDGAR records
  with 94% accuracy, standardizing names and retrieving IRS numbers.

- **Chunk Mapping**: Uses resolved identifiers to fetch EDGAR company
  data (sector, address, filings, former names) with 93% accuracy.

- **Relation extraction:** Over 90% F1-score in mapping obligations,
  rights, and conditions between entities.

- **Legal de-identification:** HIPAA-compliant PHI/PII detection with
  96% recall and 95% precision.

- **OCR accuracy:** 94% character-level accuracy on scanned legal
  documents.

- **Zero-shot NER & Relation Extraction:** 85%+ accuracy on previously
  unseen tasks without domain-specific training data.

**Deployment & Compliance**

- **Flexible deployment**: Cloud or on‑premise; Spark‑based.

- **Data sovereignty**: No PHI/PII leaves the environment; supports AWS,
  Azure, Databricks marketplaces.

- **Regulatory compliance**: HIPAA‑compliant pipelines; GDPR capable
  through local deployment.

**Real-World Legal NLP Use Cases**

- **Contract Analysis & Classification:** Automatically classify and
  process contracts, court filings, and regulatory forms; extract
  parties, dates, organizations, and document types.

- **ID & Address Field Extraction:** Process scanned agreements and IDs
  to extract names, dates of birth, ID numbers, and mailing addresses.

- **Legal De-identification for Compliance:** Detect and mask PII in
  legal documents to meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements.

- **Subpoena Entity Extraction:** Extract court names, case numbers,
  deadlines, topics, and involved parties from subpoena documents.

- **High-Volume Legal Document Processing:** Scale to millions of
  documents in production environments across AWS, Azure, Databricks, or
  on-premise Spark clusters.
