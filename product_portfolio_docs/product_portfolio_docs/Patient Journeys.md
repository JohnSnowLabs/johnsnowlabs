**Patient Journeys**

### **Overview**

John Snow Labs’ [**Patient Journey**](https://zenml.io) is a solution
for automatically constructing longitudinal, structured timelines of a
patient’s clinical experience from multiple sources of data. It
transforms structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from
**electronic health records (EHR),** notes, imaging reports, discharge
summaries, claims, and other documents, and transforms them into an
ordered sequence of clinical events modeled with the **OMOP CDM** in a
relational database. By extracting key data points – **diagnoses,
medications, procedures, symptoms, lab results, social determinants of
health (SDOH)**, and more – and aligning them to dates, the Patient
Journey timeline presents a comprehensive view of cohorts and patient’s
history.

This enables healthcare teams to review an entire course of care at a
glance, identify treatment patterns or gaps, derive insights that would
otherwise remain buried in narrative records, and manage cohorts of
interest. The platform handles **negation and uncertainty** (so that
false mentions like “no evidence of diabetes” are recognized as such)
and performs **cross-document entity resolution**, linking information
about the same problem or medication across different notes. The output
is a platform on top of standardized healthcare data in OMOP CDM, with
interfaces to common formats in the field (such as **FHIR resources or
CDISC SDTM** for clinical trials) to integrate with downstream analytics
and databases.

Importantly, Patient Journey is built on John Snow Labs’ proven
Healthcare NLP platform – which is *ranked \#1 in accuracy for
healthcare NLP tasks* – ensuring state-of-the-art extraction quality. It
seamlessly integrates with the rest of the JSL ecosystem (Spark NLP
libraries, Healthcare NLP models, and the Terminology Server) to map
clinical texts to standardized codes and ontologies, and to enable
advanced use cases like cohort finding and clinical question answering.

### **Use Cases**

The Patient Journey platform supports a broad range of use cases across
providers, life science companies, and payers:

- **Clinical Care & Provider Informatics:** Healthcare providers use
  Patient Journey to assemble a complete timeline of each patient’s
  care. For example, during complex case reviews or care transitions,
  clinicians can see **all relevant events across hospital visits** in
  order – admissions, diagnoses, procedures, medications, follow-ups –
  in one view, rather than searching through siloed notes. This supports
  care coordination, chronic disease management, and quality improvement
  initiatives. Providers can quickly spot gaps (e.g. a missed follow-up
  or a long gap in medication refills), identify trends (such as
  worsening lab values over time), and ensure care is consistent with
  guidelines. In population health and quality teams, automatically
  constructed timelines help in **identifying high-risk patients** (e.g.
  frequent readmissions or rapid disease progression) and in auditing
  whether care milestones (screenings, immunizations, etc.) occurred on
  schedule.

- **Life Sciences – RWE and HEOR:** Pharma and biotech companies
  leverage Patient Journey to analyze real-world treatment pathways and
  outcomes. The platform can process large real-world datasets (from
  hospital EHRs, claims, registries) into standardized patient journey
  datasets for **outcomes research and health economics studies**.
  Analysts can query these longitudinal data to understand how patients
  move through lines of therapy, where adherence drops off, and how
  outcomes unfold over time. For instance, an oncology study might
  reconstruct thousands of patient timelines to find common sequences of
  treatments and events, then measure survival or remission at specific
  timeline milestones. By matching patient journeys against **clinical
  guidelines or trial protocol criteria**, life science teams can also
  **identify patients eligible for clinical trials** or pinpoint where
  current treatment practices diverge from best-practice guidelines.
  This accelerates observational research and can inform clinical
  development or market access strategies (e.g., demonstrating treatment
  sequences and associated outcomes in the real world). Notably, the
  Patient Journey output can be directly loaded into analytics platforms
  (via OMOP or other formats) to fuel **cohort selection, comparative
  effectiveness studies, and pharmacovigilance**.

- **Payer & Health Plan Use Cases:** Payers (and provider finance teams)
  use Patient Journey to automate and enhance processes like **medical
  chart reviews, risk adjustment, and care management**. Rather than
  manual nurse review of charts for HCC coding or claims audits, the
  system can extract all documented conditions, procedures, and social
  factors for each member’s timeline. This ensures more complete capture
  of chronic conditions and comorbidities for **risk adjustment** and
  identifies gaps in care for intervention (for example, highlighting
  that a diabetic patient has no record of an annual eye exam). Patient
  Journey timelines can also support utilization management by laying
  out the sequence of interventions a patient has already undergone. In
  one application, a payer might compare a patient’s journey against
  **clinical guidelines or policy criteria** – for instance, verifying
  that conservative therapy steps occurred before an expensive
  procedure, or checking eligibility for a certain care program.
  Overall, automating patient chronology helps payers reduce manual
  abstraction costs and improve the **completeness and accuracy** of
  data used in financial and care decisions.

- **Clinical Research & Medical Affairs:** Research organizations and
  medical affairs teams benefit from Patient Journey in **protocol
  feasibility and medical insights generation**. By constructing patient
  timelines from historical data, they can simulate how
  *inclusion/exclusion criteria* would filter real patients (e.g. “at
  least 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months” can be verified on
  timelines). This supports **cohort feasibility analysis** for trial
  planning. Medical affairs and safety teams can also review anonymized
  patient journeys to understand atypical outcomes or drug safety
  signals in context – seeing the sequence of events before an adverse
  event, for example. In all these settings, having a machine-curated
  patient history that is chronological, searchable, and standardized
  allows experts to ask better questions of the data (such as “how many
  patients progressed from Stage II to Stage III within one year of
  first treatment?”) and get reliable answers faster than via
  labor-intensive chart reviews.

### **Key Features & Capabilities**

**Comprehensive Clinical Event Extraction:** Patient Journey uses
advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) models to extract a wide
array of clinical entities and events from unstructured text. These
include **diagnoses, procedures, medications (and dosages), lab test
results, vital signs, symptoms and observations, allergies, social and
lifestyle factors, clinical interventions,** and more. In total, the
underlying JSL Healthcare NLP library recognizes *400+ medical entity
types*, covering the breadth of concepts found in clinical
narratives[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=Snowflake%2C%20Oracle%29%20,).
Each extracted event is normalized (e.g., mapping “heart attack” to a
SNOMED CT code for myocardial infarction) using the integrated
**Terminology Server**, which provides resolution across **12+ coding
systems** (ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm, etc.). This ensures that the
timeline events are coded to standard vocabularies, making them suitable
for analytics and interoperability.

**Temporal Ordering & Timeline Construction:** A core capability of the
Patient Journey system is **temporal reasoning** – determining when each
event happened and ordering events
chronologically[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=Snowflake%2C%20Oracle%29%20,).
The system extracts timestamps or relative time references from the text
(e.g., *“March 2022”*, *“two weeks post-surgery”*) and **normalizes
dates**. It then assembles events along a timeline axis spanning
multiple encounters and documents for the same patient. Importantly, the
platform handles linguistic nuances like negation and uncertainty
through JSL’s state-of-the-art **assertion detection** models, so that
only clinically confirmed events are placed on the timeline (e.g., it
knows that “ruled out pneumonia” should *not* add a pneumonia diagnosis
event). The timeline construction logic also performs **cross-document
entity linking** – for instance, recognizing that “MI” in a cardiology
note refers to the same **Myocardial Infarction** already mentioned in a
discharge summary – to avoid duplicating events. The result is a
coherent, unified timeline per patient that merges data from all
available sources, with each event tagged with its source and date.

**Identification of Patterns and Gaps:** Once patient timelines are
built, the platform can automatically analyze them to detect patterns,
trends, or gaps. Built-in rules or ML models can scan a timeline to flag
important conditions (e.g., onset of a new chronic disease), **treatment
patterns** (such as lines of therapy in oncology or switches in
medication regimens), and **disease progression** (worsening stages or
increasing symptom frequency over time). They can also identify
**adherence gaps** – for example, if a medication should be taken
monthly and the timeline shows a 6-month gap in refills, or if follow-up
visits are overdue. By comparing each journey to expected care pathways
(clinical guidelines or protocol-defined schedules), the system
highlights where a patient’s journey deviates from the norm. These
capabilities enable applications like automated guideline compliance
checking and care variation analysis, where each patient’s sequence of
events is matched against an ideal sequence.

**Standards-Compatible Outputs:** Patient Journey outputs structured
data that is ready to use in enterprise analytics pipelines and
databases. Every extracted event is associated with standardized codes
and timestamps, which can be exported to **interoperable formats**.
Out-of-the-box, the platform can generate **HL7 FHIR** resources (e.g.,
Condition resources for diagnoses, MedicationStatement for meds,
Observation for labs, etc.) that represent the timeline events in a
standard JSON format. This is particularly useful for life sciences
real-world evidence teams who use OMOP – the Patient Journey becomes an
automated ETL to populate OMOP with derived facts from text. For
clinical trials, extracted timeline data can be aligned to **CDISC
SDTM** domains (like Medical History, Concomitant Medications, Adverse
Events), speeding up the assembly of study datasets. By providing these
formats, JSL’s solution ensures the timelines are “analytics-ready”
without manual re-entry, and easily integrate with BI tools, data
warehouses, or data science notebooks for further analysis.

**Integration with JSL Ecosystem:** Patient Journey is not a black-box
point solution, but rather is built to integrate with John Snow Labs’
broader AI platform. It runs on the proven **Spark NLP for Healthcare**
libraries, meaning organizations can take advantage of existing
pretrained models and pipelines or fine-tune them on their own data.
Users can customize the pipeline (e.g., add an entity extractor for a
new entity type or integrate a rule-based component for a specific
pattern) using the same Spark NLP framework. The platform also connects
with the **JSL Terminology Server** for real-time code mappings and
leveraging custom dictionaries or ontologies. This **modularity and
integration** capability means the Patient Journey timelines can become
a foundational data asset that multiple teams and tools can leverage.
(For instance, a hospital could use the timeline data both to power a
clinician-facing timeline UI and to drive backend analytics that predict
risks based on those timelines.)

**Enterprise Scalability & Performance:** Built on Apache Spark and
optimized algorithms, Patient Journey is designed to handle
**large-scale data**. It can process millions of clinical notes and
records to assemble timelines for entire patient populations, leveraging
cluster computing for speed. The solution has been **deployed to analyze
millions of patients and billions of documents** in real-world projects,
demonstrating its ability to scale to enterprise workloads. The pipeline
is optimized with techniques like partitioning by patients and parallel
processing, and it can leverage GPUs for model inference where
available. This scalability ensures that even as data volumes grow
(e.g., a health system adding years of records or a payer processing
nationwide claims), the timeline construction remains efficient. Many
manual processes that took weeks can be accelerated to hours with this
automation, all while maintaining high accuracy.

**Advanced Query and Analytics Support:** In addition to constructing
timelines, the platform enables advanced analysis on them. It supports
**natural language querying** of patient timelines – for example, a user
could ask in plain English: “Find patients over 50 with untreated Stage
3 CKD in the last 2 years” and the system can interpret this by
filtering the structured timeline data (leveraging the combination of
NLP and the structured OMOP
backend)[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=John%20Snow%20Labs%20developed%20a,consistency%20and%20explainability%20in%20production).
This is facilitated by the integration of **medical LLMs** and
structured query generation: the system can translate clinical questions
into database queries against the timeline data store. By combining the
timeline data with an LLM-driven interface, Patient Journey allows
clinical analysts to perform cohort building and exploratory analysis
without writing complex SQL – a capability already demonstrated in JSL’s
implementations (which achieved accurate results and even outperformed
general GPT-4 on specialized
tasks)[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=John%20Snow%20Labs%20developed%20a,consistency%20and%20explainability%20in%20production).
Furthermore, built-in **visualizations** can present the timeline data
in interactive charts or Gantt views for users. While end-user UI is not
the primary focus of this overview, the data can be plugged into
dashboard tools to provide physicians or analysts with a visual timeline
or to aggregate journey metrics (e.g., average time from diagnosis to
treatment across patients).

**Flexibility and Custom Augmentation:** Patient Journey was designed to
allow computations to be performed on top of the standardized data. With
the support of generative AI systems, users can easily define and create
new custom metrics or calculations to be added to the data processing
pipeline, allowing multiple analysis for specific applications, from
clinical calculations like BMI to Safety Measures for healthcare
institutions.

**Provenance and Compliance:** Built-in in the platform is the
capability to track provenance of data, allowing for merging and
duplication of data coming from different sources into a unique and
standardized model. Compliance and interested parties can follow the
origin of each data point up to the source location, understand how the
data was processed, and what is the confidence associated to it.

### **Performance & Benchmarks**

John Snow Labs’ Patient Journey leverages the industry’s leading
clinical NLP technology, which has been benchmarked extensively for
accuracy. The underlying information extraction models (NER, relation
extraction, etc.) are **state-of-the-art** – for example, JSL’s clinical
NLP has achieved **96%+ F1-score** on challenging tasks like identifying
protected health information, significantly outperforming alternatives.
For clinical event extraction (problems, meds, procedures, etc.), the
system’s precision and recall are similarly high, often in the 85–95%
range in published evaluations. In fact, John Snow Labs’ solutions have
repeatedly **matched or exceeded human expert accuracy** on certain
tasks. A hospital case study showed \>99% accuracy in information
extraction compared to manual chart review by clinicians. Moreover, an
independent evaluation noted that *“state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques can now approach human accuracy”* in complex extraction tasks
**and do so at scale**. This high accuracy translates to the timeline
construction: key events on the Patient Journey timeline closely align
with what a careful human reviewer would capture from the records.

**Timeline Completeness** – a critical metric for longitudinal
extraction – has also proven to be excellent. Internal benchmarks
indicate that the automated Patient Journey captures the vast majority
of relevant clinical events documented in patient charts, being able to
identify more than 96% of the events related to specific procedures or
conditions in the studies. This demonstrates that the timeline built by
the system is highly faithful to the source data, closely mirroring
manual chart review in completeness. In areas like outpatient
medications (where data can be more fragmented), the automated system
still performed respectably, and ongoing improvements in the models
continue to close these gaps. The result is that clinicians and analysts
can trust that an automated timeline is an accurate reflection of the
patient’s documented journey.

Another advantage observed in practice is **throughput and
scalability**. Automated extraction vastly outpaces manual chart review.
In one retrospective study, a manual abstraction effort covered ~4,100
patients over several weeks, whereas an automated pipeline processed the
*same* 4,100 patients **plus** an additional ~20,000 patients in the
same time
frame[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34741892/#:~:text=,systems%20occurs%20through).
In other words, NLP was able to analyze about *6 times more patient
records* in the time it took human reviewers to do the initial subset.
This highlights how Patient Journey can enable analyses that would be
impractical manually – for instance, assembling a 30,000-patient
cohort’s journeys in a matter of hours, where manual review would take
months. Even on a per-document basis, the pipeline can extract and
structure data in seconds, whereas a human might spend 10–15 minutes per
note. The **speed does not come at the cost of accuracy**, thanks to the
tuned healthcare-specific models.

Finally, when comparing **specialized solutions vs. generic AI**,
Patient Journey shows clear performance benefits. General-purpose NLP or
off-the-shelf AI may struggle with clinical language nuance and temporal
reasoning, leading to omissions or errors in a timeline. By contrast,
John Snow Labs’ models – which are *pre-trained on extensive medical
text and continuously improved by clinical NLP experts* – consistently
demonstrate stronger results. For example, JSL’s medical language models
have shown **30% higher accuracy in summarizing clinical notes** than
GPT-4 in head-to-head testszenml.io. They also drastically reduce
factual errors (hallucinations) by grounding outputs in extracted facts.
This domain-specific accuracy advantage is reflected in the completeness
and reliability of Patient Journey timelines, especially when dealing
with complex chronicles of illness that involve many interrelated
events.

In summary, **benchmarks indicate** that Patient Journey delivers
*human-level accuracy* in extracting and sequencing clinical events,
with high precision/recall and strong agreement with manual reviews. It
achieves this at a speed and scale that manual processes cannot match,
and it outperforms generic NLP approaches in both accuracy and clinical
relevance[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=John%20Snow%20Labs%20developed%20a,consistency%20and%20explainability%20in%20production).

completeness percentages or processing times, this document uses
placeholders as needed pending official reference.)

### **Deployment & Compliance**

John Snow Labs’ Patient Journey is an enterprise-grade solution designed
for **secure, compliant deployment** in healthcare settings. The
platform can be deployed on-premises or in a cloud environment of the
customer’s choosing, and in all cases, **it runs within the customer’s
security perimeter** – *no patient data ever leaves your
infrastructure*. This is crucial for compliance with regulations like
**HIPAA**, GDPR, and other data privacy laws. Because the NLP processing
is done locally (or in your VPC cloud), sensitive health information is
not sent to any outside service or API. In fact, unlike some AI
solutions that require cloud APIs, JSL’s solution is delivered as
software (containerized and **Kubernetes-compatible**) that you control.
Hospitals and life science companies can deploy it behind their
firewall, integrate with their existing data lakes or EHR systems, and
operate under their established security policies. The software supports
major cloud platforms and big data environments – for example, it can be
deployed on **Databricks, AWS, Azure, GCP, or Hadoop clusters**, and it
is optimized for distributed Spark
execution[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=optimization%20,Deduplication).
This flexibility allows integration into modern data pipelines, whether
you are using a cloud data lake or an on-prem Hadoop cluster.

**Compliance certifications and standards:** John Snow Labs has a strong
focus on regulatory compliance. The Patient Journey solution inherits
the compliance features of the JSL Healthcare NLP platform, which has
been used in FDA-regulated environments and is **certified for HIPAA**
and GDPR use cases. All PHI handling can be configured such that
identified PHI elements (like names, MRNs) are either omitted or
tokenized in the output if needed for secondary use, ensuring
de-identification standards are met when exporting data. (Notably, JSL’s
de-identification technology, which achieved **\>99% accuracy in a
Providence Health study**, can be integrated as a pre-processing step if
creating a fully de-identified patient journey for research sharing.)
The platform also supports **audit logging and traceability** – each
extracted event is linked to source text and can be traced back for
validation, which is important for quality assurance and regulatory
audits. In deployments, organizations have performed rigorous
validations (e.g., 4-level validation including bias and fairness
checks) on JSL’s NLP to certify it for clinical use. The solution comes
with documentation to support **21 CFR Part 11** compliance (for audit
trails) when used in clinical trials settings.

**IT and Infrastructure:** From an IT perspective, Patient Journey can
be deployed via Docker containers or on a Spark cluster with JSL’s
libraries installed. John Snow Labs provides **container images and Helm
charts** for easy installation. The system is designed to be
resource-efficient – it can scale out horizontally for large batch
processing but also scale down to smaller footprints for real-time use
cases. Components of the pipeline can be allocated to use GPU or CPU as
appropriate (e.g., heavy deep learning models on GPU, lighter tasks on
CPU). The solution also supports **microservice APIs** if real-time
integration is needed: for example, a hospital could use a REST API to
request an updated timeline whenever new notes are added for a patient.
This enables embedding the functionality into EHR systems or care
management workflows. All data processing remains within the system –
there are *no external calls*, and no reliance on third-party cloud
services for NLP
processing[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=Deployment,continuously%20improved%20with%20weekly%20training)[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=presentation%20layer%20,Deduplication).
This not only keeps data secure but also provides **predictable costs**
(the model is licensed per server/cluster, not per use). In essence, the
deployment model avoids the unpredictable per-text fees of some cloud
NLP APIs and allows unlimited scaling under a fixed license, which is
attractive for enterprise budgets.

**Compliance with Emerging Standards:** The Patient Journey output
support initiatives like interoperability mandates and **value-based
care reporting**. For instance, under U.S. interoperability rules,
having patient timelines in *FHIR* format can make it easier to share
data with other providers or patients in a controlled manner. The use of
standard codes and resources ensures that if you share a timeline (after
de-identification) with a research partner, it will be interpretable.
Additionally, John Snow Labs aligns with new regulations such as the
proposed **EU AI Act** – by allowing full on-prem deployment and
transparency in how models work, it facilitates compliance (e.g.,
avoiding opaque “black box” algorithms operating outside oversight). The
models themselves undergo continuous validation to prevent biases and to
ensure **fair performance across demographics**, which is a compliance
and ethics consideration in AI. JSL publishes many of its model
benchmarks in peer-reviewed literature, underscoring a commitment to
transparency.

In summary, **Patient Journey is deployed as a secure, self-contained
solution under the customer’s control**. It meets healthcare compliance
needs by design (keeping PHI in-house, offering de-id integration,
supporting audit logs) and is flexible to install in a variety of IT
environments. Clients have successfully deployed it on Spark clusters
co-located with their data, on cloud VMs within private networks, and in
containerized platforms – all while maintaining the necessary safeguards
for sensitive health data.

### **Real-World Use Cases**

**Oncology Timeline & Guideline Adherence:** A large cancer center
implemented Patient Journey to help tumor boards review patients’
treatment histories. For each cancer patient, the system extracted
events like diagnoses (with staging), radiology findings, surgeries,
chemotherapy sessions, and follow-up visits from the EHR notes and
assembled a chronological **oncology timeline**. On these timelines,
oncologists could clearly see the sequence of care: e.g. *Initial
diagnosis → first-line therapy start → response assessment → second-line
therapy*, etc. The platform also automatically compared each timeline
against NCCN clinical guidelines for that cancer type, flagging where
the care pathway diverged (for instance, if a recommended test was
missing before starting a therapy). This enabled the tumor board to
easily **identify deviations from best practices** and discuss
corrective actions. In one case, the system highlighted that a patient
had no genetic testing event prior to a second-line therapy, leading the
team to order the appropriate test. By building oncology patient
timelines and aligning them with recommended guidelines, the center
achieved more consistent, evidence-based care.

**Real-World Evidence in Pharma (Treatment Pathways):** A pharmaceutical
RWE team used Patient Journey to analyze treatment patterns for a
chronic disease (multiple sclerosis) across thousands of patients. They
ingested years of de-identified clinical notes from a consortium of
neurology clinics. The Patient Journey system extracted key events such
as MS relapses, treatments (e.g. start and stop of disease-modifying
therapies), MRI result findings, and ED visits, and created a timeline
for each patient. By aggregating these, the team was able to visualize
common **treatment pathways** and quantify outcomes: for example, they
found that patients who switched therapies within the first year had a
higher rate of subsequent hospitalizations. Crucially, the automated
approach uncovered patterns that manual chart review might have missed
at scale. The pharma team also used the timelines to match patients
against a trial’s eligibility criteria (e.g. “at least 1 relapse in the
past 12 months despite treatment”) – something that was done in seconds
per patient by querying the structured timeline, rather than an hour per
chart manually. This project demonstrated how **understanding the
patient experience journey can improve the pharma value chain**, from
identifying unmet needs to designing better trials and educating
providers on treatment sequencing.

**Quality Improvement and Care Coordination:** In a large integrated
health system, quality improvement analysts employed Patient Journey to
track and improve care for patients with complex chronic conditions. One
initiative focused on patients with **heart failure** who were
frequently readmitted. The Patient Journey tool was used to generate a
timeline for each target patient, compiling outpatient cardiology notes,
hospital discharge summaries, medication lists, lab results (e.g. BNP
levels), and even device data from clinics. By reviewing these
timelines, the team could pinpoint **critical junctions** in care – for
instance, a pattern emerged that many patients who were readmitted had
gaps in their medication titration timeline or missed follow-up
appointments post-discharge. In response, the health system set up
alerts and interventions at those key timeline points (a follow-up call
if no cardiology visit occurred within 2 weeks of discharge, etc.). The
result was a measurable reduction in 30-day readmissions. This use of
patient journey timelines provided a holistic view that was previously
unavailable from siloed systems, thereby directly informing care
coordination improvements. In another example at the same system, the
behavioral health department used the tool to identify **mental
health-related events** in pediatric patients’ journeys (e.g. counseling
notes, school assessments, relevant social factors) to ensure early
intervention for high-risk youth. Aggregating a child’s longitudinal
history in this way allowed a more proactive and informed approach to
behavioral healthcare.

### **Customer Proof Points**

John Snow Labs’ Patient Journey (and underlying NLP platform) has been
validated by multiple customers and independent evaluations. Below are a
few representative proof points:

- **SelectData (Home Health Coding Company):** By integrating John Snow
  Labs’ NLP into their workflow, SelectData achieved a *10% increase in
  overall productivity* for processing clinical documents, *while
  ensuring 95% accuracy* in its automated recommendations. This meant
  faster turnaround in coding and documentation with accuracy on par
  with expert staff. According to the CIO of SelectData, *“the good news
  is that state-of-the-art deep learning techniques can now approach
  human accuracy in these tasks – and do so at scale.”* This endorsement
  highlights that JSL’s solutions deliver near-human accuracy with
  significant efficiency gains, a cornerstone benefit of Patient
  Journey.

- **Providence Health (Compliance Team):** In a compliance-driven
  evaluation, Providence Health’s experts conducted a blind comparison
  of John Snow Labs’ extraction vs. human performance. The result: JSL’s
  solution exceeded *99% accuracy compared to human reviewers*. While
  this test was focused on de-identification, it demonstrates the level
  of trust that a major health system placed in the NLP accuracy.
  Achieving **regulatory-grade performance** gave Providence the
  confidence to automate tasks previously done manually. The same level
  of rigor is applied in Patient Journey’s clinical event extraction
  models, which are built on the similarly robust NLP foundation.

- **Healthcare NLP Benchmark Leader:** Across many benchmark challenges
  and peer-reviewed studies, John Snow Labs has emerged as a leader in
  healthcare NLP. For instance, JSL’s models ranked first in multiple
  categories of the 2022 n2c2 clinical NLP challenges and have
  outperformed big tech offerings (Azure, AWS, etc.) in head-to-head
  comparisons. One peer-reviewed paper showed JSL’s solution detecting
  clinical information with a **96% F1-score, versus 83% for a leading
  generic system**. This level of performance extends to the complex
  task of timeline extraction, where general AI tools often falter. By
  choosing Patient Journey, customers are leveraging the same
  award-winning technology that has *consistently topped industry
  benchmarks for accuracy*.

- **OMOP Integration for Databricks (HIMSS ’25 Announcement):** John
  Snow Labs publicly demonstrated the Patient Journey capability at
  HIMSS 2025 in partnership with Databricks and others. In that
  presentation, they showed how diverse data sources (EHR notes, HL7
  FHIR feeds, PDFs) can be transformed into a *unified patient timeline*
  that enables natural language questions on the Databricks Lakehouse,
  and highlighted the solution’s value for organizations seeking **OMOP
  data enrichment**. This proof point underlines the platform’s
  readiness for modern cloud analytics: a health system can plug Patient
  Journey into a data lake and immediately start getting structured,
  analytics-ready patient timelines out, with demonstrated success in a
  large-scale environment.

- **Clinical User Acceptance:** In deployments of Patient Journey,
  clinical end-users (physicians, nurses, data abstractors) have
  expressed positive feedback on the clarity and utility of the
  generated timelines. At one hospital, clinicians noted that the
  timeline view “felt like a concise patient story,” allowing them to
  absorb a patient’s history in minutes rather than wading through
  dozens of notes. Importantly, because each timeline entry is traceable
  to the source documentation, clinicians gained trust in the system’s
  accuracy (they could click and see the original note snippet if
  needed). This *traceability and transparency* have been key to user
  adoption, turning skeptics of “black box AI” into users who now rely
  on the timeline for daily workflow. Furthermore, in an evaluation by
  practicing doctors, JSL’s timeline/question-answering system was found
  to yield more **clinically relevant and consistent answers** than a
  general GPT-4-based
  approach[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=purposes%3A%20,Instead%2C%20it%20uses%20a%20multi)[zenml.io](https://www.zenml.io/llmops-database/healthcare-patient-journey-analysis-platform-with-multimodal-llms#:~:text=to%20database%20operations%20,Schema),
  reinforcing that domain-specific AI provides tangible improvements
  that clinicians can appreciate.

Overall, the evidence from customers and evaluations shows that
**Patient Journey delivers real value**: significantly reducing manual
