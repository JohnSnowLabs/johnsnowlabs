State\-of\-the\-Art Healthcare NLP in 1 Line of Code with John Snow Labs

The speaker in the video is __David Talby__, CTO at __John Snow Labs__\. He focuses on __Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) in healthcare__ and demonstrates how to achieve state\-of\-the\-art medical, clinical, and biomedical NLP using just __one line of Python code__\.

Below is a detailed summary of the speech provided in the transcript excerpts:

### __John Snow Labs and Spark NLP Overview__

David Talby identifies himself as working with the team behind the __Spark NLP library__\. This library offers APIs for Python, Java, and Scala\. Spark NLP is currently the __most popular NLP library in the enterprise__ and outside research for deploying AI systems, especially within the healthcare space\.

Key statistics and market standing for Spark NLP:

- It has been the most popular enterprise NLP library for four years\.
- An industry survey by Gaijin Flow indicated that Spark NLP for Healthcare holds a __59% market share__ within the healthcare and life science domain\.
- The library currently averages around __one and a half million downloads per month__\.

### __Core Use Cases in Healthcare__

John Snow Labs highlights various applications where strong NLP is essential because critical decision\-making information is often only available in __free text__\. These use cases include:

- Clinical decision support\.
- Matching patients to clinical trials\.
- Building real\-world data databases, especially in oncology \(which involves reading pathology, radiology, and sequencing reports\)\.
- Automated question answering on patient data or clinical guidelines\.
- Building __biomedical knowledge graphs__ by reading patents, internal documents, biomedical research, and clinical trial reports\.
- Automatically discovering adverse drug events from clinical data and social media data\.

### __Components for State\-of\-the\-Art NLP__

To achieve state\-of\-the\-art results efficiently, two components are utilized: __Spark NLP for Healthcare__ and the __NLU Library__\.

#### __1\. Spark NLP for Healthcare__

This is a software product built on top of the open\-source Spark NLP library\. It offers:

- Over __4,000 pre\-trained models__ and embeddings\.
- Support for over 200 languages\.
- Ability to scale to a cluster for training or inference\.
- Optimizations done continuously with Intel and NVIDIA for high performance, production deployment, security, and privacy\.
- __Key Healthcare NLP Tasks:__ Clinical Name Entity Recognition \(NER\), entity linking \(mapping entities to terminologies in context\), assertion status detection, relation extraction, and de\-identification\.
- All models are __deep learning transfer learning models__ and are trainable\. Users can use an annotation tool to load their own data, annotate it, and quickly develop high\-accuracy models tuned for specific domains \(e\.g\., dentistry or ophthalmology\) using active learning and transfer learning\.

#### __2\. The NLU Library__

The NLU library is a newer, open\-source library that aims to bring the accuracy, scalability, and production readiness of Spark NLP to the __Python ecosystem with simple Python commands__\.

- A primary goal is that the vast majority of tasks should be executable with __just one line of code__\.
- The library automatically handles downloading, loading, optimizing models, embeddings, and pipelines\.
- It integrates seamlessly within Python, accepting input as a string, a __Pandas data frame__, an array data frame, or a Spark data frame, and returning results in the same format\.

### __General NLU Capabilities and Examples__

The NLU library offers numerous features beyond healthcare, including:

- __Name Entity Recognition \(NER\):__ Identifying entities like people and locations \(e\.g\., identifying "Angela Merkel" as a person and "Germany" as a location\)\.
- __Document Classification:__ Hundreds of pre\-trained models are available, such as models for fake news detection, financial data, or legal data\.
- __Other functions:__ Automated grammar correction, changing writing styles \(e\.g\., from informal to formal\), question answering, dependency analysis, part\-of\-speech tagging, spell checking, sentiment and emotion classification, and translation in many languages\.

### __Defining State\-of\-the\-Art \(SOTA\)__

David Talby emphasizes that __State\-of\-the\-Art \(SOTA\)__ is a strict academic term, not a marketing term\. John Snow Labs measures itself by:

- Demonstrating the best accuracy on competitive academic benchmarks where dozens of research teams have previously competed\.
- Publishing __peer\-reviewed papers__ that validate these results\.
- Releasing the code publicly so that other researchers can reproduce and verify the results\.
- Requiring that the product achieves SOTA results in the context of a system that has __multiple production deployments__, showing it works reliably outside of a lab environment\.

### __State\-of\-the\-Art Clinical and Biomedical Results__

The presentation provides specific examples of how the one\-line\-of\-code approach is used for complex clinical tasks:

__Task__

__Key Functionality and Specific Examples__

__SOTA Claims & Performance__

__Clinical Name Entity Recognition \(NER\)__

Extracting information like drug details \(dosage, frequency, strength, routeâ€”e\.g\., "30 milligrams," "po," "q 12 hours"\), clinical risk factors \(obesity, diabetes, hypertension\), and findings from radiology reports\. The software recognizes more than 150 clinical entities\.

A 2021 paper achieved new SOTA accuracy for three competitive benchmarks: 2010 i2b2, 2014 n2c2 text classification, and 2018 n2c2 medication extraction\. A later 2021 paper showed the solution leading AWS Medical Comprehension and Google Cloud Healthcare API by __more than 10% in F1 accuracy__ for extracting medical problems, tests, and drugs\.

__De\-identification__

High\-accuracy identification of sensitive data in free text, including patient names, doctor names, hospital names, addresses, dates, codes, and professions\.

Achieved SOTA accuracy in benchmarks\.

__Biomedical NER__

Reading medical research papers to extract genes, human phenotypes, DNA/protein mutations, species, viruses, and specific gene variants\.

A late 2020 paper achieved new SOTA accuracy for __seven out of eight__ widely used biomedical NER benchmarks\.

__Assertion Status Detection__

Determines if a recognized entity \(e\.g\., "cancer"\) is present, absent, possible, or a family issue\. This is crucial as recognizing the word alone is insufficient\.

A paper published last year improved SOTA accuracy using the MIMIC\-III benchmark data\.

__Relation Extraction__

Finds relationships between entities, such as connecting a symptom to a body part and direction \("numbness in the left hand"\) or linking diagnoses, treatments, and dates\. It can also extract drug\-drug relationships from biomedical data \(e\.g\., PubMed\)\.

New peer\-reviewed papers demonstrate SOTA results for several widely used relation extraction models in the clinical and biomedical domains\.

### __Conclusion and Resources__

Additional capabilities include automated text classification for clinical text, adverse event detection, and question answering on clinical data\.

The speaker invites the audience to attend the __Healthcare NLP Summit__ in early April\. Furthermore, over __300 live demos__ are available at nlp\.johnson\.com/demos, including Streamlit apps and Colab demos, allowing users to test the models on their own data\.
