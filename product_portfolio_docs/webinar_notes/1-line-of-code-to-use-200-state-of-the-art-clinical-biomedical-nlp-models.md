hello and welcome my name is christian cassin luon and i'm a senior data scientist at royal snow labs and the ceo of dijkstra labs and i've been working in big data and data science for almost 10 years now and today i will show you how you can leverage in just one line of code over 200 state of the art biomedical llp models for over 50 domains which we will cover all today so to first to understand in case you don't know what is spark and the p and john snow maps we just do a quick 30 second recap because it's relevant to know so what spark nlp spark np and the healthcare version of it provide all of the ones and the software we use and sparklp is basically a big data library for the nlp domain focusing on being the most accurate fastest and scalable model library out there and it has accumulated millions of downloads in only a few years since its inception and by now it has become the most widely used nlp library in the industry and used by many honorable customers and awarded by the

industry with various awards for excellent work and if you look at all the features and all the models you really see why spark nlp and nowadays also the new library has all of the features could wish for and in over 4000 models in and over 200 languages and a new and just one line of code but you might already know this we've done a couple of webinars for that today we will attack the healthcare domain with energy and i will show you how you can use any of the 200 healthcare models for the roughly 50 domains of healthcare problems and i will explain them all to you and show them to you with complete examples we will do a quick recap of how to use nlu which is basically just two methods you need to know and maybe a third one and after that we go all over all the algorithms in the medical library of spark nlp and animal basically which will be the name the entity recognizer the assertion models the identification resolution and relation and for all of them we cover all of the problems c

alled attack so just a quick overview and cheat sheet here are some almost all of the features um spark nlp for healthcare and a new offer for you on the one side you can get all of the medical terminologies like snowman cpt s and so on and extract extract named entities from dozens of domains and of course get relationship between individual entities and assert the status and of course extract them and so how would you use this with nlu how do you get all of this magic all of this power it's very simple you just need to know there's a lot load method and in it you put the name of the model or nowadays we like to call the name of the model in span because it's like magic okay so you put the spell name or model name in the node and it will return to you and model object and this model object has a predict method it can take your independence data frame for all the pythonic data structures or even simple strings and so in a concrete example you would say nl.load emotion and then you have

the model object and with the model you can say model.predict i know nlu and this gets to appenders data frame which one exactly this so if you type n you don't load emotion dot predict i love lnu in just one line you get this data frame which deep learning sentence embeddings the category of the sentence which will be predicted in this case it's an emotional classifier either a surprise sadness joy or fear and in this case it's a joyful sentence so it has a category of joy and we have also all the other confidences here cool so that's already everything you need to know right there's a new load and model predict that's it and then maybe i will show you there's more than this for visualization but that's all so now we covered the lu basics and now we can go into the meaty stuff the overview of all of the ner domains we have in uh john snow labs so for the ner basically i created this table structure and nice overview for all the domains and you can see here quickly on the first glimsp

e the first column tells you what's the what's the domain so in the first case is an adverse event model or there are multiple even of them and you have here in the description so this finds adverse events between drug entities and problems and you can get it with the enemy spell met ner dot other bio bird right that's just the model name and some entities that can be extracted would be aspirin or vomiting and they would be predicted as drug and other and in the very last column you always have the reference links to the data set or paper and all relevant links and so um we will use all of them in the notebook which we come to in a second but just so you understand the structure because of this table because we will see it a lot and then now on the first glimpse we already see ah we can get adverse rock events anatomy molecular entities chemical data drug data pathology risk factors cancer disease data clinical admission data and much much more and maybe also interesting is the protect

ed healthcare information which is relevant for the the unknown immunization and there is even so there are so many domains that there's even a second page the second slide for even more any ar domains where there's like the general one and the radiology and a couple more but this was it for the medical any ar domains we will see them in action in just a second but now we come to the assertion model domains and if you're not familiar with these algorithms don't worry i will explain them in detail when we are at the code now you just get this these slides as a quick reference so for the assertion you have you can assert for either there's either the radiology domain so you can assert the status of radiology entity and i will elaborate what that exactly means a little bit and also um on the other side at the health care entities you can assert the status of a healthcare entity and they are basically three flavors but they are basically pretty much the same give or take class and then one

of the very interesting and powerful algorithms are the resolution algorithms or models they basically take as input an entity and give us output and a code or label right and this is very relevant if you feed these resolvers diseases or problems because there are many medical coding standards defined that the we can give you an idea for all your diseases and so in concrete examples we have the cm or the pcs version the icd-0 the hcc is for the billing and the first three are for diseases basically and oncology and we go into them in a bit again and we have basically cpt which is again for problems basically the loic hpo umls snowman and even what you can get is the rx mode of all your trucks and the normalized version and code of the truck and finally the most complex and advanced algorithm and domain we offer are the relationship domains and relation basically means that for every entity right if you have a sentence with multiple entities each pair of entity can be in some relations

hip and this relationship we can try to extract and predict which the relationship extractor models and some of the domains at the beginning it might sound confusing but if we go to the examples it becomes makes all sense we can basically get a relationship between dates and clinical entities or body parts and directions or body parts and concrete problems or body parts and procedures and adverse events basically phenotypes temporal events tests and results together with dates and then of course also clinical clinical problems and then the more complex relationships which have basically many many classes um are like ddi for um drug drug interactions pathology and also chemical interactions which are defined in 10 classes basically cool and yes since the relation table is so big it's actually again split up in two sides you have here the first overview and then on the second side you have actually all the examples which you can i encourage you to take closer look in detail after um this

webinar but we will go also into this examples now more detail so now it's time for the coding so what you do is you open a new tab and you google and then you draw snow wraps get high and if google is good yeah it gets the typo and we basically go to the jon snow labs and a new github page right there's the github page of value we click on all we do today will be in the examples folder and there is the webinar folder and in there there is the healthcare healthcare webinar folder and here is everything we will be doing today then you have the webinar notebook so this one mighty notebook how do you open it you just click here and open it and this one notebook will cover everything we do today this table is not properly rendered but we will see it again in a second but basically um what i have what we have here you on the side you have a very nice table of contents right you can always open and close it which can be very helpful with a very large notebook like this oops let me leave it

open and basically in the beginning here we have first of all the overview of all ner models which i just mentioned so we just i just throw over this right um these are all the ner models all the search models with nice explanation and we come to this again in a second the resolution models and the relation extraction models with a nice explanation but now we want to actually get started with coding and get the super basics with nlu going and then um play with the half condominiums so to get started with lu all you need to do is hit this play button and install new but i already did that so i will close this but what you would do is run this and i already prepared the same notebook here for us um and it's already warm and has new installed for us so i imagine now you already installed this and now what is the next step it would be that you run this set and if you run this cell since we are using licensed code and license features in lmu you need a sparklp for healthcare license usually

you should have been emailed one via email you should have this json file and you just upload it here you click on choose file and upload the json file and that's all you need to do okay and for some reason you don't want to do this or cannot do this you can also manually enter all your secrets you can open the file or check your email and enter them all here and uncomment this and then run a new note out or read the docs but this is basically how you would set up the outdoor authorization if you upload the file and then you will automatically detect it and now we can have some fun and so as a super basic intro or example i have here a very standard ner and i can now run this again um but it makes pretty much send me sense and i won't be running most of the call today because there's a lot of code and we don't have so much time um but i have everything pre-cached and basically what are we doing here we are loading any our model any r pipe into this any our pipe variable it's the model

and it has a predict method as we've seen on the slides and i am predicting on the entities peter loves to visit berlin and this takes over second but while this takes a second we can already look at the next port where we see the um any once the any outline is done we can call an additional method to this method and with this method we can basically visualize the output of almost any um uh model with an energy and in this case we can visualize the named entity um labels so this case the model predicts for peta that it is a person and berlin is a gpe in this case gpe means country and so and also maybe to get a rough high level idea of um what's the name entity well this is computing um we could maybe skim this interest what is maybe a named entity in general named entities right um they are substrings in your text data which can be classified as subclass so you could have the tags tesla is a great stock to invest in and then tesla is a named entity and it's of type company right and

that's already it so it's basically five segments in your text that belong to a specific class and here in the our overview you see in this sample entities these are the text the text you give it the piece of text and in the labels it's the class that's predicted right and we now will go over all these classes cool and then now going back here cool now it's already also done so what happened now once we run the computation we as i mentioned on the slides we get the pandas data frame and it gives us gives us one row for detected entity so the first one is peter and it's of class person and we have the confidence and also vert embeddings for it and then of course we have berlin and it's of type gpe and then of course we can visualize that and this is all we need to know today right we everything we will be using now we will repeat this pattern all the time we will load the model we will predict one time we call this these are the three steps we now will repeat 50 times okay this is all y

ou need to remember and then you only need to know what are the spells the model names okay cool so let's get started with the medical domains so the first medical domain we can use are genes and phenotypes phenotypes if you are not familiar with the term are basically observable physical properties of an organism right um like blue hairs or um bleeding from the ear also so basically things you can observe and so here is a concrete example how first of all do you know this model you just say met any r dot human phenotype or gene biobit and this gives you now again the model and with it you can predict on the string in this case we say the uphop for express expression in the patient shows pony something and pulling something and some honesty and basically uh we can see the first term up four is a gene poorly harmonized is a hp hp means um phenotype and polyuria is also hp and the last form is also one and then of course instead of looking at the table which is eye straining we can now j

ust also look at the visualization right away and then we see r okay right we confirm our pog is a gene then all the things the only three terms are hp entities perfect and now that's all you need to know to scan and search all your data for hp and gene entities oh that's it next domain is the adverse drug events domain what's an adverse drug event adverse usually means a bad effect of taking a drug and so one example could be and so what are first of all the entities we can get drug or other for the adverse effect and we could say patient reports when taking aspirin he experiences most bleeding but when using power silver mole no bleeding from nodes and then we can look again straight now we can just go to the visualization we don't need to look at the table because we can go faster i think a little bit and we can see that aspirin is a drug and nose bleeding is a adverse drug event and we also see past intermole as a drug but no bleeding from those is not an adverse event because no b

ad effect right that's not an event so we properly extracted the adverse effects and can distinguish from actual effects and not actual adverse effects perfect then the next domain which will come later very in handy for the relation extraction is there another to be any r which lets you find all the mentionings of um anatomical parts basically or also um cells or body parts so sample entities would be like tubules aspirators android bodies mk cells and so on and the classes in the same order would be tissue structural organism anatomical structures same anatomical system and so on so a lot of complex terms and the structure we can extract from all this data right and now here we have a semi long text we can instead of reading this we can look straight at the visualization right this is the visualization and the prediction is always the same text okay so we can always look at the picture unless you really want to see what's the confidence then you can pause the video or look at the not

ebook okay so we can see our patient skin is an organ started peeling off after falling on his head the head is an organism subdivision of the full body basically and then we see ah the the muscle although the organ is intact and then we see dominates a multi-structure cancer is a pathological formation as well as cancerous and cancer and the lag is again a subdivision and so on so we see loss of structure in an information gate and now a more simpler but yet very powerful domain is the bacterial species domain it only has one label species but it understands or most of the um bacterial mentionings in the concrete medical terms so if you say something like spirocheta lithogras seems to attack miseria vaswati and i looked up these actual virus names or bacterial names it detects that these two are species of bacteria perfect and and then you can easily scan for all relevant bacteria in your data set right so all of these ner models they give you basically the ability to scan and filter

thousands or thousands of medical documents for relevant entities and then another semi-similar domain is cellular molecular biology ner which gives you as the name suggests genes molecules and cells of biology related entities so you can have something like human t cell no chemo virus virus type something or primary t nope something or all these other terms right and then in the same order the first term is a dna the second term is a cell a cell line rna and protein and if this is uh if all of these terms or terms like these appear in the free text again instead of reading all of this we go straight to the visualization but you already see the structure right this is this is just a blob of text and now boom we have a predependence data frame we see our text protein text responsive elements dna tres dna et cetera et cetera and in the visualization we see it even nicer taxes protein these two are dna entities this is also dna text again protein jar is a protein etc right so lots of stru

cture again uncovered from auditor next domain are the chemical genes and protein nr's this is again slightly different from the previous ones it can distinguish between chemical gene y and gene and basically and a concrete example for this would be the terms basically keratinocyte growth factor and nitrogen these all of them are gene wise and nitrogen is a chemical together with nf kappa b are mitogens right and then we see the relevant types of genes for more data on the other sound on the other side if you want super simple chemicals nothing more than chemicals you can just use the chemical compounds in er it just detects chemicals and nothing else and as you might see some nerves might overlap but again it's always use the right tool at the right time for you the right problem and so if you just want to get the chemicals and don't want to distinguish what types are you could say resveratrol and beta poly phenol can be a dangerous mix and then you know these two are chemicals cool a

nd then on the other side there are also chemicals used in drugs or so-called drug chems and you get it by the way always right you see always the space i didn't mention all the spells but it goes without saying there's always a different spell in each new domain right we need to update the space so for drug chemical right we just say met any art or drugs and we say patient is treated with anthracionals salmons amnesia and then we see are these two are chapters and they are related to a drug treatment and then the next very very powerful domain which will come again later into play when we look at the relation extraction is the postology and pathology is basically if you don't know the science of drug prescription and how to describe drugs and the dosaging of drugs and so here we have basically a very long text with prescriptions and the table you already see oh by the way and how you get it again made any out of pathology and you have entities like dosage drug duration form frequency

route and strength and now in the concrete visualization example you can say patient is given fragment is the drug with the dosage of five thousand with uh subconsciously as wrote daily uh as frequency zen diagonal is dropped and so on and you can see already all the text this unstructured data starts lighting up with all kinds of structures and patterns we can look for and we will see how the relation extraction gets us even nicer patterns and information but this is already very cool okay so now we can also extract risk factors and risk factors are basically entities like coronary artery disease or smoker or obese or the family family history related entities so things that tell you how risky a patient is or especially these things are relevant for insurance companies and they tell you how risky is it to ensure an obese smoker that has also diabetes it's most likely riskier to destroy this guy than a healthy guy and as a concrete example again we can say patient is obese and diagnose

d with diabetes mellitus and has hypertension and hyperphilemia and he took for five years now we know all the um risk factors basically or everything relevant for that on the other side if we now want um cancer related genetic entities of which there are quite a lot things like amino acid anatomical structure again a couple of cell entities but this time it's more granular so you can get more precise with your analysis which gives you more entities which in some cases again you might want this granularity sometimes it's not what you need but again you have lots of granular individual entities about multi-tissue structure organ organism and so on and in a concrete example we can just say have here a couple of proteins and a dna cool and then a very simple yet powerful ner is the disease ndr and it gives you basically all the diseases it's just similar as the shell drug any are it just predicts one label the disease label and that's it already very powerful so in this complete example y

ou can say the cyst is developing rapidly there's a disease and death is imminent another disease so that's that so um the next domain is the medical problem treatment and test domain these are basically three types of entities as name stressed problems like bleeding from ear tests like mrt scan and treatment like amputation is a treatment and in a concrete example and you can see here and again how would you not notice you just say med any r dot health care and you say a 28 year old female with a history of diabetes and type 2 meletos these are all the problems and it's bees etc and mbmi is test basically etc etc is vomiting so lots of problems this lady has and lots of treatments we can see here in the end she was treated she was on metrophene glycine and all kinds of things cool and then in the next domain we have the clinical admission domain this domain gives us an overview of entities related to the admission of patients into a hospital or clinic so if the patient is admit admitt

ed there are things like the date the time problem test treatment occurrence and also the clinic he went to and so all we want to extract and in a simple example we can say the patient presented which is an occurrence to the emergency room in this case the location last evening is the time cool and then on the other side we also have genetic variants which basically um detects three types of um medical entities the dna mutation protein mutation and snp what's which stands for single nucleoid poly physics and so i double checked i googled what also uh i actually took a text from marine medical text from an abstract and just made all of these shorter and we have here for example we can see ah the t10 something is a dna mutation the protein the p something is a protein mutation and we can extract all of these and the rs3 and the rs8 something something they are single nucleotide poly fizzles okay and you can extract all of this again with one line you can get all of these entities and inf

ormations and all documents with this information from your database cool so next domain is the clinical is the protected healthcare information so most hospitals or most healthcare providers need to follow some kind of data regulation and protect the data of the customers and with the ner models we provide you can give a model a long piece of text and find all the entities which are a entity that is protected healthcare information so which would these be so like the organization doctor username profession the location the state the patient this is the phone number etc and here we see our it detects this this is critical information this is the date the doctor that's critical information this is the doctor this is the medical record this is the day the patient this is an age etc etc and so we can later use this to actually since now we know what pieces of text are protected healthcare information we can later on just anonymize them or obfuscate them okay and then next domain is the so

cial determinants or demographic data in er which basically lets you extract um entities that are relevant for determining the social um not stables but the um occurrences or like the determinants basically which kind of define the social studies so basically it's entities like age diagnosis dosage drug frequency etc and all of these are relevant to define what kind of healthcare services can be provided or also relevant for analyzing um your medical records and so concrete example is you can get things like the 21 year old patient the male person the congestion and the symptom name tired or denies this is a negation and so on so lots of information there cool and now we come to some of the very broad and powerful ner models on the one side you have the general clinical ner and as you can see it can predict a lot of entities and almost anything that could occur in a clinic and so here's a concrete example with a lot of text oops now i just go too fast um yes here we are and here we see

we can get things like if what part of the text is the section header the age the race when was he admitted the clinical department to test the test results and so on so a lot of high level relevant clinical information and on the other side you can get also medical terms based on the mentioned data set which are more on the medical side and if you compare them there's actually a lot of difference between the entities and again here we see just a couple but there are a lot more you could get and then now there are a couple of radiology ner models there's on one side the small radiology one which gets to general entities like image test image technique or measurements or body parts and it's something like a direction or things that are found because of an mrt scan and also the body parts basically and there's an extended version of this the so-called um what we call radiology vip greedy bio world which has all of the previous entities plus some clinical entities and then there's the ev

en white here and then what we call jslv2 or just js lvip clinical rd which comes with a lot more clinical entities so it's basically a measure between radiology entities and clinical entities and a lot of entities so lots of information you can extract from this could and then oh yeah here you see some of the radiology entities again you can get things like body parts symptom injury and so on and now we come to the assertion domain models and overview so before we jump into the two or actually like four models we have let's actually clarify what is assertion what does that mean so i have here three simple sentences the first one is billy hates having a headache the other one is billy has a headache and the third one is billy said his father has regular headaches and so all these three entities if you scan them with the ner all three of them will have the headache entity but only the first only the second sentence right really has a headache only in that document there actually is a he

adache present in the patient the other two are mentioning headaches but there is nobody actually having any headache and this is solved by the resolution algorithm or models it basically predicts for every entity the the class or status of the entity and there could be multiple classes in this scenario we could just say he has like present or not present but there are more complex ones like possible plan someone else past and so on and how would this be useful like a concrete use case would be imagine you want to analyze the survival rate of heart attacks okay and how would you do that you have a database of a million clinical patient records and you apply any r right say hey i apply the ner on the data i get all the records with a headache but then this problem i just mentioned will happen you get everything that's talking about headache even if a patient doesn't actually has one and so what you would do to analyze that or in our case i mean heart attack to analyze all the patients

who have a heart attack actually have one you get all the heart attack entities and then you also put a filter condition basically and say each entity must also be asserted as present and if it is absent or something else we're not interested okay so this is the rough overview for assertion and the first domain concretely for assertion is radiology so for radiology related entities we can predict if something is confirmed negative or suspected or disconnected it's fine um in this case on the radiology so we have three sentences and it's visualized below here and you see the visualization visualizations are a bit different now so i put in all three sentences and below the x-ray scan it tells me it's a test and below that it gives me the assorted status that i just mentioned so the um x-ray scan shows a hypothetical problem in the lung and and cancer problem is prior to present though what i mean and the x-ray scan shows no sign of cancer in the lung so that is absent right which makes

sense and the x-ray raises suspicion of um possibility of cancer in the lung so here we have the possible stars right now we say maybe maybe not right so there are multiple ways of how you can use that to filter your data on the other hand you have the healthcare and clinical version version of the assertion which is extended by jon snowlabs data and it basically asserts if the disease or problem is present absent possible planned and so on as past family or hypothetical so here a couple of visualized examples um the patient diagnosed with cancer um in 1999 so that's problem present and then yes and then the other sentence says there's no sign of cancer cancer so that's absent right here we say no sign of cancer um by the test and then tests indicate patient might have cancer then we say ah this one is possible and hypothetical and then we say city ct scan is planned for 1999 and then we say ah this is a planned entity right and then we say the patient lag was amputated last year so th

at's the past and we can even say the patient's father has cancer so this is then we say ah this is not the patient but the father or the family and we can say cancer is still possible so again the possibility and then the other one is the healthcare clinical one with a couple less entities but it's basically the same just without the family instead it's just someone else so we did not go into detail but it's basically mostly the same cool and then there's also the healthcare classical which again is also almost the same so we will not go into detail it's again the same example and mostly the same entities so that's why i mean you have two domains getting let's get back to overview quickly you have two domains basically radiology and then three flavors of healthcare okay and here you see the concrete entities and examples for them as well if you want to take the time good and then next after the assertion i mean the um yeah the assertion we can take a look at the identification really

quickly it's super easy how would you do that all you say is a record and so you give it some text data with phi information and then you see their records and then date has been offered escaped with test assessment alpha stated id the date with clinical department and so on so it basically anonymizes the data for us perfect good now we come to the next quite large domain and also quite complex it is the one of the relation models and first maybe you can give again a quick glimpse of the relation models um we need though to understand what is the relation or how how do the relationship extractor models actually work what's the magic behind it so most the sentences we have right they have multiple entities okay and each entity can has have a certain relationship to every other entity in the data set and what we can do is we can basically predict is there a relationship or not either for the binary case or we can also say there's a multi-class relationship um and then predict the case fo

r that and so a concrete example would be let's say we want to analyze the survival rate of amputation procedures but performed on the left hand so how many people survive when you take off the left hand how would you do that not easily you say okay i use the ner model and i scan for all the entities or all the sentences where we have the entity amputation the entity left which is the direction entity and the np entity hand right that's a body part but then here's the problem right this let's say we have this as a filter right we want amputation left and hand but then if we have this sentence the patient's left foot and his right hand were amputated this sample says left foot and right and hand but the hand was not taken off right so this data sample this record would be a false record in our connection right because we want to filter all the data for relevant records so how can we fix this problem we can say that there must be a relationship between the um left foot between the left f

oot and and between the left and the hand and t right so the left is the direction entity and hand is body part entity and they can be related in this example left and foot is related but left and hand are not in relationship right and the entity right and hand are also not they are in relationship okay and so we can limit the filter and say you only want the entities where there is the left entity right or literally left and the hand entity and they must be in relationship if they are not like in this example we don't want to consider them okay and so this relationship we can of course predict and detect with the body parts and direction relationship model because what's relevant to know is basically each relationship predictor takes again two entities and they are usually of two types in this case they are always of type paths and direction and so we predict that left and hand must be in a relationship but then there is another edge case which we will not get imagine now the sentence

the patient's left hand was saved but the foot was amputated so um how do we fix that what can we do in that case we can leverage the body parts and directions relationship extractor for i mean the body parts and procedures right so an amputation is a procedure type entity and the hand is a body part right and we want to find a relationship that the procedure which in this case is amputation is performed on the left hand and so we can again use two types of relationships now we say we want only the hand and left so first of all a directional relationship between left and hand and then also a um apply it like a procedural relationship between the hand and the amputation all right if all of these conditions are met then we can properly analyze the survival rate of um amputations of the left hand okay cool um and now i hope we have a rough idea of the relation extractors now we go over all of them but quickly to get a high level view again you see the first ones we recover they are binar

y type of relationship right and either there is relationship or not like left hand and left hand and left hand hand are related or not okay or a problem like pain in the ear is present or not and then of course you can get adverse events like an adverse event event is caused by a drop or not and then what follows after that are the multi-class relationship for tempora you can have uh after before over uh overlap and for dates even more and clinical problems have also a lot and we will come to them right away now so what's the first one first one is dates and clinical entities so for a date entity and a clinic clinic type of entity we can find out if or what is the relationship so this scenario if it says one they are related and so we say the patient developed cancer after mercury poisoning in 95 and all of this has relationship one because it happened at the same time but since 21 patients showed signs of leukemia so this happened is related with 21 but this is not related with the o

ther ones right and how would you get this by the way of course all we keep doing now is of course we just say energy.load and the only thing we must specify now is there any r model in front and then you define the um relation model because you always put any ar model in front because you need entities first and then you can find relationship if there is no entity model then you have nothing to fight relationships off right good and then the next um domain is the body part and direction we already mentioned that so we go right to the visualization right and all you need to do is uh say or see is that you can say patience left foot was amputated so left and foot are related right this yes this relationship between the direction is true but in this case the right foot and the right arm were safe so in this case this right and key refers to this foot right this is what we have here maybe like a full screen this uh as a one but this right does not refer to this right or this arm and this

is why there is a zero or this foot is not referring to this right but the foot is not related with that arm right so we know r there's no relationship cool as i mentioned in the analytical problem this is very useful and then of course besides the directions you can also see if there's a relationship between a body part and a problem let's say bleeding at the ear okay or in this example patient reported numbness in his left hand or you can say um you also repay a reported pain in the shoulder and so the pain and the shoulder are related and the numbness and the hand but there is no pain in the hand right good and then so this is the problem right problems are things like pain bleeding um numbness but on the other side we also have things like procedures procedures are things like performing ultrasound amputating your hand um performing heart surgery and so on right everything you perform on the patient or a doctor does to the patient and in this case we can say the chest was scanned w

ith a portable ultrasound and an amputation was performed on the foot right so this is the procedure and this is the body part or we can say a test was performed on the body part cool and now to a slightly more complex domain or actually no this is still binary this is the adverse drop event domain is also quite simple if we go to the all you need right is this relation of other and if we go to the visualization um we can see uh for a sentence i've been taking liptor for 15 years and have experienced severe fatigue so that is an adverse effect something bad that happened because of the tone and then he says doctor moved me to wonderland two months ago so far have only experienced cramps so volatility and cramps are again also a related adverse effect perfect and then on the other hand you also have another binary relationship between phenotypes phenotype abnormalities so if something is broken with a human basically and genes or diseases and so a concrete example is you can say she has

retinal generation which is a human phenotype right or in this case a problem with the human phenotype and hearing loss which is another phenotype caused by a mutation in the c3 picks to be some g right and then you see r this gene is related with the hearing loss and this gene also causes the degeneration but the gene but the hp entities are not related right good and then we have the temporal events which give us the relationship between clinical entities and time entities and we can predict that cancer happens in 1991 or somebody was admitted after the cancer or um somebody was discharged before receiving some procedure right and here we have a couple examples like cancer in 1991 or male clinic in 2020 and also discharge in 2021 cool and then next we have the dates and tests and results in this case it's all again a bit similar than the previous one but we have slightly some different relationships on the one side you can say something is a finding of something for example we can s

ay um on march 1995 um an x-ray was applied right and because of the x-ray we found the headache maybe let's look at this in the visualization right away we see on 1995 there was an x-ray applied and the tumor is the finding of this x-ray or this test right and after that we have the clinical clinical problem treatment test domain which basically gives you dozens of um or not thousands found a couple of relationships that can be between problem tests and treatment and we can go um further down here where we see the example um very clearly so the first relationship is trip which is means that the problem has improved because of a medical cure so you say the infection was resolved with antibiotic cause so it got better right on the other hand you have the trwp patient's medical problem became first because of treatment so it wasn't so in this example you say the tumor was growing despite the drain and then you have the other relationships like um a treatment cause the problem like penici

llin causes a rush rash or you can say um a treatment was administered for a problem for example dexa framing for narcolepsy or the administration was voided because of a medical problem for example raphael was not given because of chaos and then on the other side and and revealed a particular fusion this is um a test has revealed a medical problem so the rp relationship and the cp says a test was performed to investigate a problem further so x-ray for plumier to investigate the telomere and finally um if something is related to each other so so arts presume secondary in sepsis cool and then if you have a larger text of course this gets very structured and very fast and if you have the time take a closer look please later um but next we take a closer look at the ddi domain of relationships so once the relationship between one drug and another drug or what is the interaction and so there can be um five types of interactions advice effect and mechanism and and basically advice means you

advise to take something effect means something is affected by something else it means we already know that it's established mechanism is a mechanism the force is there's no interaction and we can see um aspirin should not be used in combination with paracetamol or unprepensive drugs um potentially a xanax is an effect of gambling boxing is a mechanism on patent fleeing or our steam does not interact with global entirely cool and this is already how you get all the relations there are a couple more though so though another very powerful one is a postology relationship i already mentioned right we already can get postological entities and now we can find the relationship so if it's an adverse event and dosage and duration form frequency reason route or strength and so more concretely we can see here that um oops it's a bit tricky to read oh and the first one is the top five milligram of extraordinary dosage took us daily for two weeks that's the duration right and then um relationship w

ith this drug right then i took aspirin as tablets as a form aspirin usage is weakness frequency um and then you can also say aspirin orally or strength drug like two milligrams of aspirin is the strength cool and then i just want to show this um is what can go wrong if you have too many relationships you can end up with quite a messy plot like this and i thought this looks pretty funny so we can keep it in um but after that there's one very huge domain left for us and it's the chemical and proteins and we then basically are basically the champ or paper and then the data set will find ten types of relationships between chemicals and proteins which fall in the categories of part of regulator up regulator down regulator arguments antagonist modulator and cofactor and here you have a couple of examples for them um but yes i leave it up to you to check them all but because i think we are a bit long on time now and you can have some fun going into some chemistry topics but you have here car

bonized examples and the last things or last thing we should cover is just the data structure of what you actually get when you predict right what what does the data structure of this pandas data frame look like when you predict on the relationship type model right that's what i didn't mention so far and it's pretty simple though you get one row per predictive relationship so in this case we have the uh let's look at the body parts and direction right so you have patience left foot was amputated the right foot and the right arm were safe so if you look in the relation column this first potential is their relation yes or no and between one entity one which is left entity and that's the class of this entity and then entity two which is foot and then we see left and foot have one so they're related ah makes sense right all right and foot and one they're related but right and right have a zero their model makes sense not related right and arm in this case the arm this right the first right

doesn't uh refer to that um but the other right has one right so now you know the rough data structure basically you have one row per relationship and similarly for the assertion which i didn't mention so i'll just mention it now briefly you of course get one row per entity and predicted um assertion right so if you have ten entities here cancer cancer scan cancer ct scan um you get for each entity here one row and then the asserted samples of it and of course always the confidences and all the additional data great okay so now we covered um all of the algorithms except the final one and one of the most powerful ones the resolution models so what are actually resolution models what can we do with them and why are they powerful again a simple example to show light why and how they are applied imagine again you have a simple string tesla is a great stock to invest in and there's the entity tesla right and we know this is a named entity but now look at these three strings tesla is a grea

t stock to invest oops or you can say tesla is a great stock or tesla inc is the great stock all of these three entities are of type company and they are referring to the same company but they do not have the same form in our data if we would do a group buy this won't be grouped because it's not the same and this is very bad for data analysis and how we solve this is that we say we give every company an id and let's say tesla gets the id 3. and so then what we can do is we give all of these entities to our resolution algorithm and for each entity it predicts the id and in this case it would predict for all of these three mentionings of tesla that it is of id3 right because it makes sense so and this of course is done with the resolution algorithm and is a very powerful way to analyze your data and of course in all the previous examples mentioned it's written in the text but i didn't mention it you always should verb on a resolution basis right because you all don't since exactly this p

roblem would occur right you should always when possible work on the resolve codes because the string data can always have various forms and representations and you want always a universal meaning or terminology defined and so in the medical world has a lot of terminologies defined we can leverage and jsn has prepared for you to resolve your entities so what you can do is basically you can have tons of diseases or procedures and mapped them to international coding standards some of them or the first one would be the icd-10 the international coding standard from who for general diseases and so you can map each disease to each to its icd-10-cm port or there's also the icd-10-ps pcs code for procedures or the oncology version for icmeo on the htc is for buildable stuff cpt is another procedural terminology link for general identifiers hpo for the human phenotype ontology umns for that standard and snowman and rx storm for the corresponding domains and rx norm of course for the trunks and

i show you how to use them it's super easy again all you need to know is just you put in the mdr model and then the name of the resolver and that's all you need to know and then you predict with the model and in this example and again you get one row per entity and then you get an additional entity right with no art the first entity is tobacco and it's of course smoking and we have confidence and then we have the sentence resolution which resolves in the iso 10 cm this is defined with normalized string as top aqua use so it gets a normal version of the string and the chord which is z202 and if you look it up in the database it is actually the right one it will show up as tobacco usage and you can of course visualize this and the visualization basically again adds another row below the entity class you see the code and the normalized version and we see hypertension has a code chronicle reason suffering has also called so icdcm just as background knowledge is basically diseases and probl

ems but icd-10 pcs is for procedures so for example we can say the cast was removed from the face and so the cast like the medical cast and that is a concrete procedure that has id and a code as well as like a ct scan was performed and that has also a scan and a normalized version on the other side for cancer or quality based problems there's a poll on terminology or coding standard the icto which you can also use to get the ontological ids or the ico ids of ontological entities like mesothema is this here and malignant is that and so on and the hcc is used by doctors and and insurance companies to define how much a treatment should be paid or reimbursed right the defense defines as a doctor how much can you get paid for some thing you performed on a patient and it again defines it's based on the icm10 cm codes and the pcs as well and it defines for every procedure basically again code and then from that you can derive uh pricing and cpt is basically similar um to icp-10 it's basically

more focused on procedure services and diagnostics and again um gets to the end and the codes and also the normalized version for everything so an amputation is a procedure with id six one etc and has this normalized version or heart plan transplant is also a procedure with this code and left is the direction good and on the other side you also have the link which is basically logical observation identifiers and names and another coding system used for various entities mostly for findings of test results so if you have a test and you find something out it's used for that and also to basically label or call or define numbers or codes for the tests and after that we have hpo for the human phenotype ontology so every phenotype of human is labeled for example the disorders include cancer bipolar and you see all of them start on hp and they have the normalized hp meaning and correspond to that and then finally almost finally we have the urls with which is a unified um medical language syst

em another coding standard um applicable to a similar domain basically so we can just use the same sentence and then get basically the different course of the different terminology since each domain speaks also its own language we easily have here the umls codes or you can also use the snomed cp version so you get the snomed codes which is also basically medical codes for procedures and problems and there's on the one side the ct version and again um here is a big oh yeah and snowmelt is actually an extension for the general clinical context and clinical terminologies right so for example um we can say a woman like like gender or infant they are all um mapped on the clinic name they are also mapped basically which is not defined in snowmen in the previous terminologies and then there's the international version of snowman which is basically just the international version of that and the conditions which is basically the snomed for conditions and finally we have the rx small which gives

you the normalized rx norm version of the drug and also the rx so the identifier or the id and so here in the visualization we can see he was seen with some service she was discharged with 50 milligram a triple gram is dropped with the id and at night is frequency etc etc so here you can really see um all the power and all the knowledge you can extract with nlu and all of the healthcare models i really um i can encourage you go over all the tables which are at the very top or also at the beginning of every section there you can have a really great overview of all the tools of titans you can use to revolutionize the healthcare industry so i hope you learned a lot so far or today and this is basically the end of the presentation so here are a couple more resources and articles for anyone and here is the end of the presentation so thank you very much for your attention feel free to email me or contact me on linkedin for any questions and feedback and i love to reply to you so thank you v

ery much and goodbye

## **Detailed Summary of the Speech**

The speech, presented by Christian Cassin Luon, focuses on demonstrating how to utilize **over 200 state-of-the-art biomedical NLP models** from John Snow Labs across more than 50 domains using just one line of code.

### **1. Spark NLP and NLU Basics**

The presentation begins with a recap of Spark NLP, which is described as a big data library for the NLP domain focused on being the most **accurate, fastest, and scalable model library**. The library, including its healthcare version, has accumulated millions of downloads and is the most widely used NLP library in the industry. It currently contains over 4,000 models and supports over 200 languages.

The key to accessing these models is **NLU** (Natural Language Understanding). The basic usage pattern involves three steps:

1.  **Load the model:** Using the nlu.load() method and specifying the model's name or "spell name".

2.  **Predict:** Calling the model.predict() method on the resulting model object, which accepts simple strings, Python data structures, or Pandas DataFrames.

3.  **Visualize:** Calling an additional method for visualization. The output of a prediction is typically a **Pandas DataFrame**.

### **2. Core Medical Algorithms Overview**

The medical library covers several core algorithms: **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, **Assertion Models**, **Identification**, **Resolution**, and **Relation Extraction**.

#### **A. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Domains**

NER identifies substrings in text that belong to a specific class (e.g., person, company). In the healthcare context, NER is powerful for scanning and filtering medical documents. Numerous domains are supported:

- **Clinical/Disease & Risk Factors:** Genes and Phenotypes (observable physical properties of an organism), Adverse Drug Events (distinguishes bad effects from actual effects), Risk Factors (e.g., *coronary artery disease*, *smoker*, *obese*, *diabetes*), Disease NER (predicts the general 'disease' label), and Medical Problem, Treatment, and Test domain.

- **Anatomy & Biology:** Anatomy NER (finds anatomical parts, cells, body parts, tissues, etc.), Bacterial Species (identifies bacterial names), and Cellular Molecular Biology NER (identifies genes, molecules, cells, DNA, RNA, protein).

- **Chemical & Drug:** Chemical Genes and Protein NER (distinguishes between chemical, gene Y, and gene), Chemical Compounds (detects only chemicals), and Drug Chems (chemicals used in drugs).

- **Dosology/Pathology:** Extracts drug prescription details such as **dosage, drug, duration, form, frequency, route, and strength**.

- **Genetic Information:** Cancer-Related Genetic Entities (granular information about multi-tissue structures and organisms), and Genetic Variants (detects DNA mutation, protein mutation, and SNP-Single Nucleotide Polymorphism).

- **Clinical Context:** Clinical Admission (entities related to hospital admission, including date, time, location, and occurrence), General Clinical NER (a broad model covering section headers, age, race, and test results).

- **Protected Health Information (PHI):** The PHI NER model finds critical, protected data (e.g., organization, doctor, date, phone number, age) so that they can be anonymized or obfuscated.

- **Radiology:** Several Radiology NER models exist (small, extended, JSLv2) to extract entities like image test, technique, measurements, and body parts.

#### **B. Assertion Models**

Assertion models are vital because they **predict the status or context of an entity**, solving the problem of false positives where an entity is merely *mentioned* but not *present* in the patient (e.g., "Billy's father has a headache" versus "Billy has a headache"). Assertion allows filtering data for conditions that are actually **present**.

- **Radiology Domain:** Asserts statuses like confirmed, negative, suspected.

- **Healthcare/Clinical Domain:** Asserts statuses like **present, absent, possible, planned, past, family, or hypothetical**.

#### **C. Identification (Anonymization)**

Identification models (e.g., a.record) enable the anonymization of PHI data within text, obfuscating sensitive information like dates and IDs.

#### **D. Relation Extraction Models**

Relation models are advanced algorithms that **predict the relationship between pairs of entities** in a sentence. This is critical for analytical tasks requiring high specificity, such as ensuring an *amputation* procedure is specifically related to the *left hand*.

Relation domains covered include:

- **Binary Relationships:** Body Part and Direction (e.g., *left* and *foot* are related), Body Part and Problem (e.g., *pain* in the *shoulder*), Body Part and Procedures (e.g., *amputation* on the *foot*), Adverse Drug Event (predicts if an adverse event is caused by a drug), and Phenotype Abnormalities and Genes/Diseases.

- **Multi-Class Relationships:** Dates and Clinical Entities (identifies temporal relationships), Temporal Events (predicts relationships like *after*, *before*, *overlap*), Dates and Tests/Results (predicts findings, e.g., *tumor* is the finding of the *x-ray*).

- **Complex Interactions:** Clinical Problem/Treatment/Test (dozens of relationships like Treatment Improved Problem (TRIP), or Treatment Worsened Problem (TRWP)), Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) (five types: advice, effect, mechanism, no interaction), Dosology Relationship (between adverse event and prescription factors like dosage, duration, frequency), and Chemical and Proteins (ten types, including regulator, antagonist, cofactor).

- **Data Output:** Relation models return a Pandas DataFrame with one row per predicted relationship, listing Entity 1, Entity 2, their classes, and the relationship score or label.

#### **E. Resolution Models**

Resolution models are the "most powerful" because they take an entity, regardless of its varying textual forms (e.g., "Tesla," "Tesla Inc."), and map it to a **universal normalized string or standardized code** (ID). This is crucial for consistent data analysis and "should always" be used when possible.

John Snow Labs provides resolvers for numerous medical coding standards:

- **ICD-10-CM:** International Coding Standard for general diseases.

- **ICD-10-PCS:** For procedures.

- **ICD-O:** Oncology version for cancer/quality-based problems.

- **HCC:** Used for billing and reimbursement, based on ICD-10 codes.

- **CPT:** Procedural terminology focused on services and diagnostics.

- **LOINC:** Logical Observation Identifiers and Names, used mostly for findings of test results.

- **HPO:** Human Phenotype Ontology (labels every human phenotype).

- **UMLS:** Unified Medical Language System, another coding standard.

- **SnoMed CT:** Medical codes for procedures and problems, extending to general clinical context entities like gender or infant.

- **RxNorm:** Provides the normalized version and ID of drugs.

The output of resolution models shows the entity's code (e.g., Z202 for tobacco use) and the normalized version of the string.
