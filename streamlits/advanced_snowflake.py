    "SUMMARIZE_BIOMEDICAL_PUBMED": """Residual disease after initial surgery for ovarian cancer is the strongest prognostic factor for survival.
However, the extent of surgical resection required to achieve optimal cytoreduction is controversial.
Our goal was to estimate the effect of aggressive surgical resection on ovarian cancer patient survival.\n
A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC ovarian cancer undergoing primary surgery
was conducted between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998.
The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\n
The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis.
The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively.
After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction).
Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival;
the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival.
For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors.
Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).
Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival.
Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.

I'm diagnosed with hyperthyroid 1 month ago. I was feeling weak, light headed,poor digestion, panic attacks, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate, rapidly weight loss, from 4 months.
Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital.
I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem.
Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal .
Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I'm taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily.
I'm taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now.
I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I'm facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate.
I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay?
Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time.
Because some of my friends advising me to start allopathy and never take a chance as i can develop some serious problems.
Sorry for my poor englishüòêThank you.
